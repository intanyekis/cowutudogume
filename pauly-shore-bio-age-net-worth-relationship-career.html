Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Pauly Shore has a net worth of $30 million as an American actor and comedian. Shore is most known for his parts in comedies such as “Encino Man” (1992), “Son in Law” (1993), and “In the Army Now” (1994), but he also does stand-up comedy, directs, produces, and podcasts.</p><p>The mockumentary “Pauly Shore Stands Alone,” released in 2014, won Best Documentary at the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles, and he has presented the podcasts “Pauly Shore Podcast Show” and “Pauly Shore’s Random Rants.” Since the early 1970s, Shore’s family has owned the world-famous Comedy Store in West Hollywood.</p><p>Shore spent $1.5 million for a 4,500-square-foot mansion in the Hollywood Hills in 1996. He refurbished the property in 2015 and placed it for $13 million on the market; when he couldn’t find a buyer, he marketed it for rent for $27,000 per month. In 2020, he put the home on the market again, this time for $9.5 million.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Pauly_Shore_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Pauly Shore born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Paul Montgomery Shore was born on February 1, 1968, in Los Angeles, California. Mitzi and Sammy (a comic) founded The Comedy Store in 1972; after Mitzi and Sammy divorced in 1974, she became the sole proprietor. (Pauly took over as manager of the club upon Mitzi’s death in 2018.) Shore was born in a Jewish family with three siblings, Peter, Scott, and Sandi, and graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1986.</p><p>He grew up surrounded by comedians, and at the age of 17, he did his first stand-up act at Culver City’s Alley Cat Bistro. Sam Kinison became his mentor and frequently allowed Pauly to serve as his opening act.</p><p>Shore developed an alter persona known as “The Weasel” while traveling as a stand-up comic, in which he portrayed the role of a surfer man.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table class=celeb_stats_table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr class=row-fill><td>Net Worth:</td><td><strong>$20 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth:</td><td>Feb 1, 1968 (53 years old)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender:</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Height:</td><td>5 ft 7 in (1.71 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession:</td><td>Comedian, VJ, Actor, Screenwriter, Film Producer, Film director, Presenter, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality:</td><td>United States of America</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Pauly_Shore_Single_Relationship>Is Pauly Shore Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pauly enjoyed a string of hits. The Encino Man actor has dated Tiffani Thiessen and Kylie Minogue during his great acting career.</p><p>Meeting Pauly Shore on the set of his movie Biodome in 1997 was the “worst move of her career,” according to Kylie. In a Daily Telegraph interview, Pauly recounts her amazing experiences with Kylie.</p><p>“I was head over heels in love with her. We had a great time together despite the fact that none of us knew who the other was. Her charisma drew me in. ‘Oh my goodness, this girl is adorable.’</p><p>One of the key causes for Pauly Shore’s career downturn has been the death of his ex-girlfriend, Shannon Wilsey. When an accident scarred her face, she committed herself in 1994, shortly after parting up with Pauly.</p><p>In 1994, Pauly expressed his sadness at his ex-girlfriend’s death to The Los Angeles Times.</p><p>It was the most stunning female I’d ever seen, and it was dramatic for me.</p><p>Pauly, who has reached the end of his career, is presently single. He was photographed displaying a PDA with an unidentified girl who was thought to be his girlfriend.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Shelby Holliday, Yoon Chan Young, and Hailey Peters."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":43}{"1":49,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/shelby-holliday/"}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/yoon-chan-young/"}{"1":43}{"1":49,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/hailey-peters/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Shelby Holliday</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Yoon Chan Young</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Hailey Peters</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Comedian</a> <a href=# rel=tag>film director</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Film Producer</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Presenter</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Screenwriter</a> <a href=# rel=tag>VJ</a> <a href=# rel=tag>voice actor</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Rui Pedro dos Santos | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Kalidou Koulibaly | Parents, Religion And Ethnicity</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfpa62uNhmqqGnopp6o7XOZpignV2jsrV51qipraBdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bq%2FAq5yeql8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./174942-ray-j-shares-cute-photo-daughter-melody-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ray J of LHHH Shares Cute Photo of Daughter Melody with Her Curls Loose While Sitting on a Sofa">&larr;
