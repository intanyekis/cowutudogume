She was recently pictured with her octagenarian husband and looked as lively as ever. Despite her age, she runs a tight schedule and has said she will keep doing all she can until she no longer can.</p><p class=Fg>Age is just a number. Many believe it, but people like Barabara Eden live it. At 91, she is still very active and has shown no signs of stopping soon.</p><p class=Fg>It is no secret that as celebrities get older, they seek a quiet life away from the buzz of Hollywood, but the reverse is the case for Eden, who seems as active as she has always been. She has kept up public appearances over the years, and her name has remained relevant despite her age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/23d6d8b09e6550cdaf650d0199977509.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Barbara Eden and Jon Eicholtz attend Make-A-Wish Greater LA's Wish Gala 2022 presented by Gibson Dunn at Paramount Studios | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>This month, she made a stunning appearance alongside her 83-year-old husband at the Make-A-Wish Greater LA's Wish Gala 2022, which Gibson Dunn presented at Paramount Studios on November 19, 2022.</p><p class=Fg>If her look from 2019, when the actress <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7713661/Barbara-Eden-88-looks-glamorous-Paley-Honors.html>turned up</a> at the Paley Honors: A Special Tribute to Television's Comedy Legend, was called glamorous, then this latest look should be called blissful as that was how she looked from head to toe. No wonder her husband and thousands of fans could not stop gawking at her successfully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8933005238def102d4e6cb6210914132.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Barbara Eden attends Make-A-Wish Greater LA's Wish Gala 2022 presented by Gibson Dunn at Paramount Studios. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>For the 2019 event, held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in L.A., Eden wore a long blue and black striped dress with mesh sleeves. She complemented the stylish number with a unique black necklace and a matching blue and black pair of earrings.</p><p class=Fg>The talented actress polished the look with a pair of black pumps and a dark blue clutch. She looked beautiful, and if nobody asked, she would have most likely passed as someone under 88.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/49f30944e21886188b209973ba4881a5.png><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>A fan's comment on Barbara Eden's look | Source: YouTube/People</p><p class=Fg>In her latest public appearance, Eden wore black pants coupled with a long-sleeved top and carried a matching purse.

One year ago, People visited her L.A. home for a tour, and she met them dressed in fashionable clothing and high heels that in no way reduced her mobility as she took them on a tour of her beautiful home.</p><p class=Fg>When the video was shared on Youtube, her appearance pleased her fans, who took to the comments section to express love for how she looks.

Outside work and daily chores, Eden has also invested her time and energy into exercising.</p><p class=Fg>In fact, until about four years ago, she regularly visited the gym, attended spin classes, and lifted weights. These days, she has to slow things down by hiring a trainer who goes to her home, where they engage in resistance training and walks around her tennis court.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5fb05a4f13bcfc44c11d2e55d8cde658.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Architect Jon Eicholtz and actress Barbara Eden attend the Go Red For Women fall 2015 fashion show on February 12, 2015 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Besides physical activity, Eden also maintains an active social life filled with many friends and acquaintances.

I still work."</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Eden's Views</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Despite how old she is, Eden has maintained her youthfulness. This is thanks partly to her healthy life choices but what truly makes this woman feel younger than her age is her mindset.
