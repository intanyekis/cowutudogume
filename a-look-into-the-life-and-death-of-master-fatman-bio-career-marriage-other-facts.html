Born as Morten Lindberg on September 23, 1965, he later adopted the moniker Master Fatman which resonates with his profession and lifestyle. Though he first got the moniker in 1987 following his attempt to incarnate Liberace, an American pianist, and actor, it stuck with him throughout his lifetime.</p><p>Lindberg’s childhood was spent with his antique bookstore dealer father and his mother.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Master_Fatman_Wore_Many_Caps_In_His_Lifetime></span><strong>Master Fatman Wore Many Caps In His Lifetime</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lindberg is remembered for many roles he took in his career. He first became established as a stage performer before shifting roles across time. Outside of his stage roles, Lindberg’s alias Master Fatman was also a writer,&nbsp; musician, food enthusiast, comic artist, and politician.</p><p>As an entertainer, his career shot to the limelight in the 1990s following his acting, producing, and directing roles. His renowned 1993 film The Gayniggers from Outer Space garnered the status of being a cult. While his movie roles remained widely unknown, his musical career was not as famous either. However, he is known to have sung in bands like Master Fatman and his freedom fighters among others.</p><p>Interestingly, Fatman’s celebrity status included his diet choices. Known for his vegetarian lifestyle, Fatman build a career around food which included doing TV shows on the subject matter.

Lindberg used his lifestyle around food enthusiasm to not only access publicity but made it his brand.</p><p>He hosted programs on the Danish national TV and had his radio show, Croque Monsieur on Radio24syv where he promoted French cuisine among many themes. The radio/TV host released his cookbook in 2017 to support his lifestyle around food.</p><p>He intentionally kicked against weight loss as the ideals of diet in the 1980s. To counter it, he went the route of gaining weight as a&nbsp; silent rebellion and over time and through the consumption of cakes and other fattening foods, he added significant weight.</p><p>As part of his image, the considerable weight worked well with his onstage consumption of food and added to his appeal as a not-slim person. Moreso he was a supporter of climate conservation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Entertainer_Was_Married_To_Herminia_Mabunbda_For_Almost_a_Decade></span><b>The Entertainer Was Married To Herminia Mabunbda For Almost a Decade</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Master-Fatman-And-Herminia.jpg><p>The Danish actor and musician are known to have been married to only one spouse throughout his life.

According to one, he met&nbsp; Herminia in 2008 during one of his numerous travels. Yet another account claim that the couple first met at the Roskilde festival in 2009.
