Nordegren and Woods have remained so strongly associated in a lot of people's minds that they wanted to know <a href=#>when she met his ex, Erica Herman</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite how long Nordegren and Woods have been associated, she moved on to a relationship with Jordan Cameron many years ago. Perhaps the reason some people don't realize that Nordegren has a new man is she has never spoken about her relationship with Cameron in public.</p><h2 id=who-is-elin-nordegren-39-s-baby-daddy-jordan-cameron>Who Is Elin Nordegren's Baby Daddy, Jordan Cameron?</h2><p>After Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren's marriage ended, the media revealed she went on to date Doug Murray and Chris Cline. Since 2017, Nordegren has been involved with Jordan Cameron and the couple had a son together in December 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jordan-cameron-when-he-played-for-the-miami-dolphins.jpg><p>Since Nordegren and Cameron got together, many people have thought of him first and foremost as the boyfriend of Tiger Woods' ex. That said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron was leading an interesting life</a> long before he even met Nordegren.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A former tight end who played in the NFL, Cameron was a part of the Cleveland Browns and the Miami Dolphins before he retired from the sport in 2017.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Person Responsible For Getting Tiger Woods And Elin Nordegren Together Has Serious Regrets</a></span></p><p>On top of Cameron's athletic career, his family has proven themselves in the sports world too. Cameron's sister Brynn played basketball in college, his brother Colby was signed by the Carolina Panthers, and the Denver Bronco's Su'a Cravens is his cousin.</p><p>Before Cameron met Nordegren in Miami, he had a son from a previous relationship. The mother of Cameron's first son has never been revealed, and it seems very likely that it never will be.</p><h2 id=why-elin-nordegren-is-so-private-about-her-relationship-with-jordan-cameron>Why Elin Nordegren Is So Private About Her Relationship With Jordan Cameron</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, Elin Nordegren and Jordan Cameron have been involved for almost six and a half years. During all of that time, Nordegren has seemingly done almost everything she can to keep her relationship with Cameron out of the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiger-woods-and-elin-nordegren-at-a-tennis-match-together.jpg><p>Unlike when Nordegren was with Woods, she has never spoken to members of the press about her relationship with Cameron. More notably, Nordegren and Cameron have never appeared at any major events alongside each other.</p><p>Given that Nordegren has never addressed her relationship with Cameron, she obviously hasn't spoken publicly about why she remains silent. For that reason, there is no way to definitively say why Nordegren is so private about her relationship with Cameron.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/elin-nordegren-has-a-clear-stance-on-tiger-woods-relationship-with-erica-herman.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, fortunately for anyone who wants to know why Nordegren is so secretive about her personal life, it is pretty easy to draw conclusions. The reason it is so easy to understand why Nordegren would avoid the press based on her history with the media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>One Day Before Tiger Woods' Scandal Went Public, Elin Nordegren Had A 30-Minute Conversation With One Of His Mistresses</a></span></p><p>Between 2001 and 2009, Elin Nordegren and Tiger Woods appeared to be extremely happy from the outside looking in. When Woods and Nordegren were seen in public together, they appeared to beam with affection for each other.</p><p>Tragically for Nordegren, all of that fell apart in a matter of days. After reports began surfacing that Woods cheated on Nordegren, loads of women came out of the woodwork to reveal their involvement with Woods.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to estimates, Woods cheated on Nordegren with 120 women the press learned about. Many times when a new woman came forward to say they were with Woods, members of the media would trip over themselves to publicize the salacious details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Did-Tiger-Woods-Offer-Elin-Nordegren-A-_350-Million-Contract-To-Get-Back-Together_-.jpg><p>In 2010 and 2014, Nordegren gave a pair of interviews to People that were the only times she publicly addressed how her marriage to Woods ended. During the 2010 interview, Nordegren expressed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how devastating it was</a> when she learned the truth about Woods' cheating.</p><p>"I felt stupid as more things were revealed — how could I not have known anything? The word betrayal isn’t strong enough. I felt like my whole world had fallen apart. It seemed that my world as I thought it was had never existed. I felt embarrassed for having been so deceived. I felt betrayed by many people around me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elin Nordegren Has An Identical Twin Sister But Their Parents Had Strict Rules When It Came To Their Image Together</a></span></p><p>Also during the 2010 interview, Nordegren explained how difficult the process of accepting the end of her marriage was for her. "I pretty much followed — and am following — the stages of grief that I have learned in my psychology studies: shock, bargaining, anger, depression—and I am still working on the last stage, forgiveness and/or acceptance."</p><p>As anyone who has been through a difficult break-up should have already known, Nordegren went through something horrible when her marriage ended. Upon reading what Nordegren told People about the end of her marriage, people should be able to have empathy for Nordegren on a visceral level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the pain Nordegren was going through as Wood's cheating became public knowledge, the media seemed to delight in reporting about the story. A perfect example of that is what happened after rumors surfaced about Nordegren and a golf club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/was-tiger-woods-forced-to-have-extensive-plastic-surgery-after-an-altercation-with-his-ex-wife-elin-nordegren_.jpg><p>According to some reports, Nordegren reacted to the cheating revelations by scratching Woods, chasing him out of their home with a golf club, and smashing his car with it. In response to those claims, Woods publicly stated that Nordegren never hit him and there wasn't any domestic violence.</p><p>Woods' statement didn't stop some members of the media from claiming that Nordegren attacked him so viciously that <a href=#>he required plastic surgery</a>. If that wasn't enough, Saturday Night Live memorably aired a sketch <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mocking the idea of Nordegren attacking Woods</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Nordegren was going through the kind of pain nobody should have to endure, the media seemed to rejoice in taking advantage of her anguish. While Nordegren has never said that is why she keeps her current relationship private, pretty much anyone would want to avoid the media if they were treated the way she was.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirop%2BVp3q4u86dqmadqGLEqrLEZpyloZ5iu7C%2Bw56eq52eYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnWoquhZamkwq%2BzxKtkm5mSrnqlrcOdsGain6exorqMnJimnaKku3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-writer-and-co-founder-of-empact.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Writer And Co-Founder Of Empact The Talks Today">&larr;
