He had a passion for the sport and possessed considerable potential. He began training at a young age and made his debut in the ring in 2008. Reid's wrestling career showed promise, and he was even set to compete in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) promotion. He was trained by Harley Race and competed in a few matches even alongside his family. <a href=#>Mostly he teamed with his brother David</a> and competed in various independent promotions. When it came to WWE, he only appeared at events alongside his dad and never really competed officially in it, but his career showed great promise.</p><p>However, behind the scenes, Reid struggled with personal demons, including substance abuse issues. Reports suggested that he had battled with drug addiction, which ultimately led to his demise. Tragically, it was on March 29, 2013, when the life of Reid Flair came to a sudden and untimely end. At the young age of 25, he was found dead in his bed at a Residence Inn located in the South Park neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several months later, on June 14, 2013, the details surrounding Reid Flair's death were revealed through the findings of his autopsy. It was concluded that his death was the result of a drug overdose. Specifically, the autopsy indicated the presence of heroin in his system, as well as traces of two prescription tranquilizers: clonazepam and alprazolam.</p><h2 id=ric-flair-struggles-with-the-passing-of-his-son>Ric Flair Struggles With The Passing Of His Son</h2><h3 id=flair-blamed-himself-for-his-son-39-s-death>Flair Blamed Himself For His Son's Death</h3><ul><li><strong>Ric Flair felt guilt following the passing of his son.</strong></li><li><strong>Triple H helped console Flair following Reid's passing.</strong></li><li><strong>Flair received a Hall of Fame ring with Reid's name on it from Triple H.</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The loss of a child is an incredibly heartbreaking experience for any parent, and it deeply affected Ric Flair, when he tragically lost his son in 2013. Following this devastating event, Flair shared his emotions and thoughts on the matter, expressing the profound impact it had on him. During an episode of To Be The Man, a concerned fan posed a significant question to Ric Flair. The fan sought Naitch's guidance and advice for individuals who have experienced the devastating loss of a child. He said,</p><p>“Not to uh….God, I don’t know! I made some bad choices after Reid passed. I would say to surround yourself with your family and not to just stray off and find so much misery within yourself.” He added, “My problem was that I blamed myself and there’s no way to share that guilt because he was with me.

He said,</p><p>"I can remember after we buried Reid, I put one of my Hall of Fame rings on Reid. At NXT one time, Hunter said, ‘I need to talk to you,’ and I maybe thought I had done something wrong. And he called me into his office, and he had a duplicate ring with Reid’s name engraved on it. That’s someone who cares.

The bond between the siblings was strong, with Charlotte always looking out for Reid as he pursued his dreams in the wrestling world. Charlotte revealed that her brother's involvement in the industry played a significant role in inspiring her to follow the path of professional wrestling. During a recent episode of The Dan LeBatard Show podcast, Charlotte Flair reflected on the memory of her late brother, Reid Flair. She said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Well, he really had a bad drug addiction and I thought if I somewhat started what he wanted to that it would get him motivated almost like jealous in a way like, ‘My sister’s doing this I got to do it too. I’ve to be better, I’ve to stay on the right course. So ever since I just think it’s gonna be that first time he sees me….well not as much, not when I first started. But to this day I’ll always think I get to do this because of him, and I’m so grateful."</p><p>Reid will forever be missed by his fans and loved ones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmekp66otcJmm56ZpJ16sLKMq6CcZZahrqq%2BjKymp2Wimralew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-love-on-top-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonce  Love On Top Lyrics">&larr;
