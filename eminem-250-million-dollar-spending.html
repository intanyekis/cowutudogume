Rising from the depths of poverty to the highest possible levels of fame and fortune, this self-made star knows a thing or two about the value of money, and is particular about how he spends it. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life hasn't always been easy for this artist.</a> His earliest days were tumultuous at home, and he was a victim of severe bullying at school. Living in a trailer park with what's been described as being an unfit mother, Marshal Mathers took to the stage to spit lyrics that oozed from his pores, and one rap battle after another led him to the domination of some of today's biggest stages.</p><p>As one of the highest paid rappers in history,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy </a>reveals Eminem's rags to riches story, and tells a tale of a man who will never forget the hard work it took to amass his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$230 million net worth</a>, so he's pretty particular about how he spends it.</p><h2 id=comic-book-obsession>Comic Book Obsession</h2><p>When we say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem</a> has a comic book obsession, we mean it. The rapper doesn't make much mention of this collection he has, but eagle-eyed fans are well aware of how much Eminem values his collection of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">high priced comics.</a> Many of his lyrics are riddled with comic book references, and his character appeared in a few comic books as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the fact that he houses a vast collection of comic books, one particular one stands out that will paint the picture of just how valuable this collection really is. There is one - just one - out of hundreds that happens to be worth well over $1 million. Yes, that's right, Eminem owns a mint condition&nbsp;Amazing Fantasy #15 comic book, that is so rare, and so valuable that he could easily ditch the rest of his collection and still do just fine!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem Performs "Lose Yourself" At The Oscars 17 Years After Song Wins Award</a></span></p><h2 id=his-family>His Family</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyone that listens to Eminem's music knows how much he loves <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his daughter, Hailie</a>. She's the apple of his eye and the center of his world, and everything he does is for the betterment of her life. Striving to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> give his daughter the type of life he never had</a>, Eminem worked hard to pay for her education and now enjoys his ability to dote on his daughter's every need. He also takes pride in taking care of his 2 adopted daughters, and Eminem cracks his wallet open with ease, anytime his family sets their sights on something they want or need.</p><h2 id=expensive-real-estate>Expensive Real Estate</h2><p>Living the life of a rapper typically involves high-priced real estate in Hollywood's most affluent areas, but Eminem has always been<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> loyal to his hometown of Detroit.</a> He owned a lavish mansion in Detroit that was a jaw dropping 17,500 square foot property, and later purchased a mansion in Rochester Hills, which sits on 15,000 square feet. This incredibly luxurious estate boasts 9 bedrooms, each of which has its own ensuite, an expansive tennis court, waterfall pool, and of course, for entertaining purposes, he also has a massive guest house&nbsp;on the premises.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With his current home worth an estimated $5 million, it's no secret that Eminem lives in the lap of luxury, with every imaginable modern convenience at his fingertips. Buying within his local hometown has meant that Eminem has been able to afford much bigger property than his fellow artists who seek prime real estate in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=very-hot-wheels>Very Hot Wheels</h2><p>For the most part, Eminem is far more focused on saving money than he is on spending it, however, he's a gear-head through and through, and he doesn't hold back when it comes to car shopping. With a need for speed and an appreciation for agile supercars, Eminem's garage is full of incredible, drool-worthy vehicles. His collection of over 12 cars includes a $150,000 Aston Martin V8 Phantom that tops out at 100 kms in under 3 seconds, as well as a very rare 575 Ferrari - one of just 2000 ever produced. He also has an Audi R8 Spyder and a Ford GT.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In spite of owning several fine machines, Eminem's passion for Porsches definitely takes the spotlight. His Porsche collection includes an exclusive Porsche Carrera GT, a Porsche 911 GT3 Rs 4, and a Porsche GT2 worth $330,000 before customization.</p><h2 id=luxurious-watches>Luxurious Watches</h2><p>Another area Eminem seems comfortable spending in is his watch collection. He has an affinity for Rolex watches and has so many in his collection that they're too tough to list. Of course, he doesn't just buy any Rolex on the market, only the most exquisite, rare models are the ones he seeks.</p><p>To add value to the fact that he spends lavishly on his timepieces, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy </a>reports on this&nbsp;as being one of the first selfish purchases he made when he began to earn big money. His manager fondly remembers Eminem's reaction when he phoned him to ask if there was enough money coming in to purchase one, without putting his daughter's education fund at risk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charities>Charities</h2><p>One of the best qualities Eminem has is his humble nature and his ability to stay grounded in spite of his elevated level of fame and fortune. He stays true to his roots and never forgets where he came from. He quietly makes donations to his hometown of Detroit and never steps up&nbsp;in search of the credit associated with his kindness.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The US News </a>reports that; "Eminem donates to food banks regularly and is a contributor to the Eight Mile Boulevard Association, which works to revitalize the public transportation system in the Detroit area. He also donates regularly to Excellence for Detroit, an organization that helps underprivileged students succeed in college."</p><p>Eminem continues to quietly donate millions of dollars to those in need through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Marshal Mathers Foundation.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Big-Ego Celebs Who Praise Eminem And 9 Who Have Beef With Him</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Marshal Mathers Foundation</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyrrXNnqRmamVleq61y6WgqKZdmbytuMCrZKyolaOxqrrGaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dan-campbell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan Campbell Wiki, Wikipedia, Wife, Salary, Wiki, Stats, Contract">&larr;
