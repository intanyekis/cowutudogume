Famed for her 2008 hit single "<strong>Paper Planes</strong>", which featured in the Oscar-winning movie&nbsp;<strong>Slumdog Millionaire</strong>,&nbsp;the rapper has been causing a commotion ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranking Every Single Madonna Album, Based On U.S. Sales</a></span></p><p>From her support for the Tamil Tigers, a Sri Lankan guerrilla group that is widely regarded as a terrorist organization, to her claims that video games encourage violence, M.I.A. has found herself among the most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial rappers</a>. Famously, she was barred from entering the U.S. in 2006, and in&nbsp;early 2016 she confirmed that she was banned from the country. Here's what she's been up to since her ban.</p><h2 id=her-black-lives-matter-comments-got-her-banned-from-a-music-festival><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Her Black Lives Matter Comments Got Her Banned From A Music Festival</span></h2><p>In the wake of&nbsp;innumerable&nbsp;killings of black people by the police, many celebs have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shown their support</a> for the Black Lives Matter movement. But M.I.A. made some rather tone deaf comments in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about her thoughts on BLM</a>, M.I.A. responded, "It's interesting that in America the problem you're allowed to talk about is Black Lives Matter... Is Beyonc√© or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter?" Understandably, the comments caused a major backlash and she was subsequently dropped from appearing at the Afropunk Festival in London.</p><h2 id=she-released-her-fifth-album-and-the-reaction-was-mixed><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She Released Her Fifth Album And The Reaction Was Mixed</span></h2><p>September 2016 saw the release of M.I.A.'s hotly anticipated album, AIM. Reunited with her erstwhile collaborator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diplo</a>, M.I.A.'s 5th studio album largely focused on the oppression of refugees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pitchfork gave the album 5.9 out of 10, writing, "After the predictably rocky months of rollout, the 17 songs of AIM read as disappointment, lacking bite and bounce, and presenting only glimmers of what once was."</p><h2 id=her-activism-continues><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Her Activism Continues</span></h2><p>Despite her countless controversial and polarizing statements over the years, M.I.A. isn't keeping quiet about her political views any time soon. As she told the New York Times&nbsp;following AIM's release, "I had the choice to shut my mouth and not be political in order to catapult my fame and popularity and my bank balance. But that's not the choice I made."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio & Other Celebs Who Are Passionate Activists</a>&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to her continued activism against the treatment of Tamils in Sri Lanka, she has been vocal in her support of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and also endorsed left wing politician Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister of Britain.</p><h2 id=she-says-she-predicted-government-surveillance><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Says She&nbsp;Predicted&nbsp;Government&nbsp;Surveillance</span></h2><p>M.I.A. has long been a vocal critic of the surveillance powers of social media. Back in 2010, she made the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contentious statement</a> that "Google and Facebook were developed by the CIA".</p><p>But following the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, in which it was revealed that Facebook had been collecting and harvesting the personal information of millions of users,&nbsp;M.I.A.&nbsp;said that she had been proven right and wasn't "some paranoid crazy person".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-allowed-back-in-the-u-s-in-2017><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Was Allowed Back In The U.S. In 2017</span></h2><p>Following her 2016 ban, M.I.A. was finally allowed back into the States in 2017. She performed at Riot Fest in Douglas Park, Chicago and at The Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York, marking her first U.S. shows since 2014.</p><h2 id=a-documentary-about-her-career-was-released-in-2018><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A Documentary About Her Career Was Released In 2018</span></h2><p>In January 2018, M.I.A. starred in a biographical documentary about her life and career. Matangi/Maya/M.I.A. was directed by Steve Loveridge and he explained that he wanted to show who the real M.I.A. is, refuting claims that she is controversy hungry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The documentary generally received positive reviews, with The Playlist writing, "If there is one note that rings clear through all the xeroxed, glitchy, abrasive background noise, it is that of authenticity and sincerity."</p><h2 id=she-teased-her-first-new-song-in-3-years><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Teased Her First New Song In 3 Years</span></h2><p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, M.I.A. released "OHMNI 202091", her first song in 3 years. She told fans that she was hoping to release her 6th album that same year, though this never materialized.</p><h2 id=she-worked-with-travis-scott><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She worked With Travis Scott</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis Scott may be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">synonymous with the Kardashian clan</a>, but he is also a talented rapper. Accordingly, M.I.A. featured on&nbsp;Scott's 2020 song "Franchise" from his&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;album Utopia.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner Fans Beg Travis Scott To Make Kylie His Wife And Not Just A 'Baby Mama'</a></span></p><p>She also&nbsp;appears in the music video, which was partly shot in the U.K., alongside fellow guest star Young Thug.</p><h2 id=her-anti-vaxx-stance-shocked-fans><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Her&nbsp;Anti-Vaxx Stance Shocked Fans</span></h2><p>Having previously made some questionable remarks regarding the supposed link between video games and IRL violence, M.I.A. has since taken aim at Covid vaccines. She was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slammed for her anti-vaxx rant</a> in 2020, in which she propagated the&nbsp;debunked&nbsp;(and scientifically implausible) conspiracy theory that coronavirus vaccines&nbsp;contain microchips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-launched-a-sustainable-sunglasses-collection><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Launched A Sustainable Sunglasses Collection</span></h2><p>Although M.I.A. had&nbsp;once&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been accused of hypocrisy</a> for collaborating with H&M, a brand widely regarded as a fast fashion giant, she has seemingly made amends in recent months.</p><p>In June of this year, M.I.A. designed a sustainable sunglasses collection in honor of World Oceans Day.
