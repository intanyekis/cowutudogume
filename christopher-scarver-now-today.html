He’d experienced intense bias during his formative years in the neighborhood.</p><p>In a moment of madness, <a href=#>Christopher Scarver was left alone with Jeff</a> and brutally ended Dahmer with an iron rod. He is famous for murdering Dahmer, but the question that comes to everybody’s mind is, here is her now; is he alive or dead? Let’s get to know the details;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About Christopher Scarver</h2><p>Wisconsin Conservation Corps volunteer Steven Lohman was murdered in 1990, and his killer, <a href=#>Christopher Scarver</a>, was given a mandatory life term. After being fired from his job, Scarver allegedly turned to alcohol and began to hear voices calling him “the chosen one.” Scarver returned to his old employment and demanded money; the site manager gave it to him. Lohman was shot three times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where can we find Christopher Scarver at this hour?</h2><p><strong>Christopher Scarver is now serving the remainder of his sentence at the Centennial Correctional Facility in Colorado.</strong> He was already serving time in prison when he committed the murders of Dahmer and Anderson. After that, he was handed two more terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole.&nbsp;</p><p>Scarver filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility in 2005, claiming it “subjected him to harsh sensory deprivation and social isolation despite his severe mental illness.”</p><p>In 2006, after a judge in district court had ruled against him, he appealed the decision, but it was for naught. After some time passed, Scarver and a few other inmates with mental illness were moved from the Wisconsin prison. He underwent a few transitions before arriving at his current location in the Colorado institution.</p><p>Scarver indicated in 2012 that he intended to write a book describing his reasoning for killing Dahmer and minutiae like Dahmer’s final statements to him. He has been discussing a book deal with a few different publishers, but nothing has been finalized between them.</p><p>Scarver has written, and self-published several poetry collections in the interim, including A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste, Pain: Poetry of Christopher J. Scarver, The Child Left Behind: Poetry of Christopher J. Scarver, and others.</p><p>A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste is one of these collections. In 2015, he published another book, The Child Left Behind. Scarver’s son, born not long after his father was initially sentenced to prison, told CNN in 2014 about how his father has stayed in touch with him and supported him when the son felt he was headed in the wrong direction. Scarver’s son was born shortly after his father was initially sentenced to prison.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyfpbWmvoysmpqqppq%2FbrrOsGStp5SWxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-sam-buttrey-jeopardy-contestant-almost-boarded-the-missing-titanic-wreckage-sub.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sam Buttrey?
