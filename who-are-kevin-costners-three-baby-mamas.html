For example, famed actor Mel Gibson has children with three different women, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his current partner</a> of many years, Rosalind Ross.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those of you who don’t know this, Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson have been friends for a very long time. With that in mind, it makes a certain amount of sense that just like Gibson, there have been three different women that Costner was linked to and he has children with all of them.</p><p>Like a lot of acting superstars, Kevin Costner has led a pretty fascinating life. For example, the relationships he had with the three different women that gave birth to his children are very interesting.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Mick Jagger's Children?</a></span></p><h2 id=contentious-affair>Contentious Affair</h2><p>After roughly 16 years of marriage, in 1994 Kevin Costner suddenly found himself on the market again. Considering that Costner was massively famous and he is a good looking man, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that it didn’t take long for him to get involved with someone. After all, when you look at Leonardo DiCaprio’s romantic history, it is abundantly clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">movie stars tend to get around</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Kevin Costner and Bridget Rooney weren’t together for very long, their fling resulted in a son named Liam. Unfortunately, at first, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Costner refused to believe that Liam was his son</a> until a paternity test proved that fact. Even then, according to a People magazine report, Costner saw Liam “occasionally but not on a regular basis”.</p><p>Born into a rich family, Bridget Rooney has been described as a Pittsburgh Steelers heiress. After Rooney and Costner went their separate ways, she would go on to marry the billionaire William Koch. While most people may not know who William is, his brothers David and Charles Koch, have become quite famous, especially in the political and business worlds.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake's Baby Mama Sophie Wishes Their Son Adonis A Happy 3rd Birthday</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=first-marriage>First Marriage</h2><p>In Hollywood, there sadly is a long history of stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving their spouses</a> once they become famous. While Kevin Costner and his first wife Cindy Costner couldn’t make things work, they were together for years after he became a big star.</p><p>While Kevin Costner was attending the University at Fullerton, he met a woman named Cindy Silva at that time. While talking to People magazine years later, Kevin revealed what he thought of Cindy when they first met. “She was beautiful, she was sweet, she was smarter than me.” “She represented everything about women that I like.” In fact, according to countryliving.com, when Kevin and Cindy met, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she resembled Snow White</a> and even played the character at Disneyland during her summer breaks from school.</p><p>After spending a lot of time together during their time at school, Kevin and Cindy tied the knot after he graduated in 1978. During the couples roughly 16 years of marriage, Kevin and Cindy welcomed three children into the world, Annie, Lily, and Joe. Sadly, in 1994 the couple got divorced and released a statement announcing they had “amicably resolved all issues regarding our children and financial affairs and a full marital settlement has been reached.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Machine Gun Kelly's Baby Mama, Emma Cannon?</a></span></p><h2 id=lasting-love>Lasting Love</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, Kevin Costner and his wife Christine Baumgartner have been married for roughly 16 years, which is the same amount of time his first marriage lasted. Thankfully for the couple, no publically available information makes it seem like they will go their separate ways at some point.</p><p>Amazingly enough, Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner first met back in the ‘80s, when he was still married to his first wife. At that time, Kevin only became acquaintances with Christine, who was working as a professional model at the time. On top of Christine’s years being paid to pose in front of cameras, she also was a successful handbag designer. More than a decade later, in 1999, Costner and Baumgartner ran into each other again, and with both of them single at the time, things quickly heated up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After four years together, Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner broke up in 2003 because they were in different places when it came to the prospect of having kids. While speaking to Closer Weekly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about the break up</a> in 2018, Costner said he “was afraid that (he) couldn’t be an effective father”. However, he came to his sense very quickly. “I woke up and thought, ‘Am I going to lose a beautiful woman who is willing to be with me to my very last breath because I am afraid to say yes to a child?’” After reuniting, Kevin and Christine got married in 2004 and they would then go on to have three kids together, Cayden, Hayes, and Grace.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We Know About The Many Baby Mamas Of Clint Eastwood’s 8 Children</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecqeraKmXZi8tMDNnqmsZaSdv6axjJuYm7Fdoq6urdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beauty-pageant-contestant-husband-smash-crown-wife-second-place-brazil.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Beauty Pageant Contestant's Husband Smashes Crown After Wife Gets Sec">&larr;
