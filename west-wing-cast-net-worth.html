There are some shows that are not so good. And there are shows that are so good that they become iconic, the very remembrance of them is a pleasure. And The West Wing is in the latter category. It ran from 1999 through 2006. Set in the White House of fictional two-term President Jed Bartlet, the show gave viewers a slice of life portrayal of what West Wing life is like for the President and his closest advisors and staff.</p><p>But what became of the actors? And how have their fortunes faired? Here is the cast of The West Wing and their current net worth, according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Of The Richest YouTube Stars From The Last Decade (& Their Net Worth)</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-schiff---5-million>Richard Schiff - $5 Million</h2><p>Richard Schiff played Toby Ziegler, a.k.a. Pokey, the White House Communications Director. He was so good that Schiff won a Primetime Best Supporting Actor Emmy Award in 2000. Schiff has said that the outspoken and liberal character Toby was not always popular with the powers that be at Time Warner, the production company. Admittedly, Toby was not a barrel of laughs, but he meant well. Usually.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With nearly 150 acting credits on IMDb, Schiff stays very, very busy. He is currently starring in The Good Doctor, playing Dr. Aaron Glassman. He's amassed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a> fortune.</p><h2 id=stockard-channing---5-million>Stockard Channing - $5 Million</h2><p>Stockard Channing's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a> comes from decades and decades of acting on stage and screen. She has done it all, from Tony Award-winning Broadway stage turns to film and TV. She got a Primetime Emmy for her portrayal of Abby Bartlet, President Bartlet's wife. How to explain Abby? Abby is dignified and strong and calls a spade a spade. She will say things to her husband no one else would dare to.</p><p>Channing has said she never meant to become an actress. It just happened, way back in the 70s and 80s. And she never reads reviews of her performances. Why? Well, because way back when some critic said she had a double chin. After that, she decided she was better off not knowing.</p><h2 id=dul-hill---8-million>Dulé Hill - $8 Million</h2><p>Dulé Hill is Charlie Young, the young Black Personal Aide to the President. Oh yeah, he also has a "thing" with Zoey Bartlet, the first daughter. He enters the White House as a young, fresh-faced student taking a year off from Georgetown University and, over the seven years grows and matures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Stars Of John Hughes Movies, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Dulé Hill is known for two things. Number one, being Charlie Young in The West Wing. And the second? He's pretty good at tap dancing. No, we don't think Charlie tapped around the White House.&nbsp; His net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$8 million.</a></p><h2 id=janel-moloney---10-million>Janel Moloney - $10 Million</h2><p>Moloney's character Donna Moss is assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff and not particularly high up in the pecking order. But, like Janel Moloney, the character surprised by wielding influence far beyond her seniority. The actress knocked it out of the ballpark as far as Donna Moss was concerned.</p><p>This was helped no little bit by the fact that Donna and Josh Lyman her boss had this on-screen chemistry. Moloney has said she knew from the very beginning of the show that Donna loved her boss. It takes them until Season 7 to jump in the sack. A long time to wait. Her net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a>.</p><h2 id=bradley-whitford---11-million>Bradley Whitford - $11 Million</h2><p>Even with a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$11 million</a>, Bradley Whitford is not resting on his laurels. Whitford is one busy actor, steadily working in TV and films. He's won three Primetime Emmys, including one for his portrayal of Josh Lyman, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff in The West Wing. As it took Josh seven years to stop dancing around and jump into the sack with Donna, you can probably tell he is a little awkward romantically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whitford has recently been seen in <a href=#>The Handmaid's Tale</a>, Get Out and Transparent. IMDb claims his trusty trademark is his cute dimples. That's a little strange.</p><h2 id=allison-janney---14-million>Allison Janney - $14 Million</h2><p>In a White House full of strong, determined women, Janney's character <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">C.J. Cregg</a> stands out. She is the Press Secretary from hell, the kind of woman who gets in your face and shouts loudly. When Deputy Communication Director Sam Seaborn's (Rob Lowe) "friendship" with a call girl comes out and Josh Lyman tries to defend him, she goes ballistic in a big way. It's a tense scene that Janney totally steals from the other actors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Impossible-To-Work-With Celebrities Fired During Filming</a></span></p><p>Janney has won so many awards (sixty plus) that she probably needs to rent extra storage space to house them all. And has all this hard work paid off? You bet it has. She has a net worth of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $14 million.</a></p><h2 id=kristin-chenoweth---16-million>Kristin Chenoweth - $16 Million</h2><p>Chenoweth played Annabeth Schott (as in bang-bang, Annabeth tells people), the White House Deputy Press Secretary. Chenoweth's distinctive speaking voice (it's been compared to Betty Boop), gave the role a slightly comic air. She joined the show in 2004, playing it for the odd laugh interspersed with serious, determined moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Annabeth is a kind of steel magnolia type that people underestimate. Chenoweth's career has taken her through stints of acting and singing, including time on the musical stage. She may only be 4 foot 11 inches, but she's a powerhouse of talent. And thanks to that and hard worth, she worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$16 million</a>.</p><h2 id=jimmy-smits---25-million>Jimmy Smits - $25 Million</h2><p>Smits is probably best remembered for playing lawyer Victor Sifuentes in the 80s runaway TV hit L.A. Law. In The West Wing, he is Congressman Matt Santos, the Democratic politician who follows Jed Bartlet into the White House after Bartlet's two terms. He goes from Congressman to President amid plots and changing loyalties. It's all very Washington D.C.</p><p>Smits has done stints in the Star Wars franchise, as well as star turns on Sons of Anarchy and Dexter. He has been one busy guy since he started his acting career. And the result is a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$25 million</a>.</p><h2 id=martin-sheen---60-million>Martin Sheen - $60 Million</h2><h2></h2><p>Martin Sheen's Democratic President Jed Bartlet is fiercely intelligent, prone to shout at people, but unerringly compassionate. It's a quirky mix that is added to by the face Bartlet suffers from bouts of multiple sclerosis that he, at first, hides from the voters. Bartlet played brilliantly by Sheen manages to stay the course and serve two terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheen is currently starring alongside Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda in Grace and Frankie. For his sins, he is also Charlie Sheen's father. With over 250 acting credits listed on IMDb, it's not surprising that the guy has racked up a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60 million</a>.</p><h2 id=rob-lowe---60-million>Rob Lowe - $60 Million</h2><p>In the 1980s he was a teen idol pretty boy, a member of the Brat Pack who starred in iconic 80s movies such as St. Elmo's Fire. A certain kind of embarrassing tape emerged in 1988, derailing his career for a time. When he joined the show in 1999, Lowe's character Sam Seaborn, the Deputy White House Communications Director, was written with the intention that Seaborn be the lead "below the stairs" character.</p><p>Only thing was, all around him were incredibly strong actors such as Martin Schiff and Allison Janney, and the Seaborn character faded into the background. Disagreements with the production company over Lowe's salary caused him to leave the show in 2003. Since then his handsome face has graced Parks and Recreation and Wild Bill. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60 million</a> is his net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Silver and Gold: 10 Richest Female Country Singers</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTEpr%2FTZq6ippdisKK%2F02alnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fighting-over-elizabeth-taylors-estate-has-begun-61455.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Fighting Over Elizabeth Taylors Estate Has Begun">&larr;
