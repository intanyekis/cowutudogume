Jackson is one of the highest-grossing movie stars of all time, appearing in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulp Fiction</a>, Goodfellas, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and The Avengers. Jackson is considered one of the most honest and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exceptionally authentic actors in Hollywood</a>. He is one of those celebrities that people love to see both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on and off-screen</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Movie legend Samuel L. Jackson has been married to actress and producer&nbsp;LaTanya Richardson for nearly 40 years. Jackson and LaTanya met at college and have been together ever since. Their daughter, Zoe Jackson, followed her parent's footsteps into the film industry and is now a TV producer.</p><h2 id=humble-childhood>Humble Childhood</h2><p>The Pulp Fiction star was born in Washington in 1948 before being taken to Tennessee to live with his grandparents when he was still a baby. Growing up, he didn't know his father, and he wasn't very close to his mother. He lived in an underprivileged neighborhood in a house with no running water. How this child became a superstar?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Samuel L. Jackson Is Caught In The Middle Of Quentin Tarantino And Spike Leeâ€™s Feud</a></span></p><p>It was aunt Edna, a theatre teacher, who introduced Samuel acting. Since he was a young boy, Edna pushed him into the stage wherever she had the chance. "She was the reason I became an actor," the actor revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> in 2012. It was his aunt who helped him overcome a condition he battled throughout childhood.</p><h2 id=how-did-jackson-and-his-wife-meet>How Did Jackson and His Wife Meet?</h2><p>Though he'd enjoyed his time in the scenery with his aunt, it wasn't until years later that captivating the public with his talent became a dreamed career for him. In the 60s, Jackson attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. His goal was to get a degree in marine biology. However, after joining a theater club for extra credit, he felt so happy that he ended up changing his major to drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Incidentally, this was also how he met the love of his life. At the time, his future wife was also studying theater in Atlanta but at Spelman College, the sister school of the college attended by Jackson. "Sam was not part of my circle. I was a theater snob; he loved movies", she told a reporter from The New York Times.</p><p>Despite their differing tastes, the pair hit it off in a drama program and began dating. Jackson graduated in 1972, and in 1976 the couple searched for the bright lights in New York, where they would each pursue acting careers. They married four years later before having their daughter Zoe.</p><p>"We thought we were going to be the black Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, but we were going to stay together," Jackson said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People magazine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=get-to-know-a-raising-in-the-sun-star-latanya-richardson>Get to Know A Raising in the Sun Star LaTanya Richardson</h2><p>LaTanya grew up in a family that was always giving, making donations to churches, and making part of organizations in charge of education and health concerns. She was raised by her grandfather, who was, most of the time, raising money for different causes.</p><p>Jackson has admitted that&nbsp;LaTanya is his rock, and thanks to her, he is one of the respected actors in his generation. She's the reason he is still alive. Jackson has revealed that his wife is his harshest critic and has driven him to become an incredible actor today.</p><p>LaTanya and Jackson had a rule for every day of their almost 40-year marriage: not to go to bed angry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel L. Jackson Literally Just Asked George Lucas If He Could Be In Star Wars</a></span></p><p>LaTanya's career has been pretty successful as well, booking roles in movies and popular TV shows. As proof of it, she was a Tony nominee in the category of Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in A Raisin in the Sun. She also made a special appearance in Grey's Anatomy in 2017 as Diane Pierce for three episodes. The actress interpreted Calpurnia in the Broadway show To Kill a Mockingbird in 2019. As she attended the theater club with his future husband when she was in college, there is no doubt of her talent as an actress.</p><p>One of the things that Jackson and LaTanya have been dealing with is growing up in broken homes. Like his wife, Jackson was brought by a single mother while his alcoholic father abandoned the family. With LaTanya, Jackson found the sense of family he craved, but they went through dark times when it seemed that the family would not last forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Screen Star-News, Jackson felt lost and could not resist temptation. The actor became addicted to heroin and cocaine. He hit his lowest point in his life when his wife and eight-year-old daughter found him overdosed on the kitchen floor. LaTanya could have just taken their daughter and walked out, but she didn't. After the incident, Jackson went to rehab.</p><p>LaTanya attributes their marriage success to the love and shared faith in God. Their relationship is an excellent example of resilience and true love.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hereâ€™s Why Jesse James Went Off The Map</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8CmrJ6kXaF6q63CpKqopqNixKqyxGaYp5xdnby4ecOim2asmJrGbrnEnqto</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-brent-faiyaz-the-rb-singer-who-just-released-wasteland.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why 'Wasteland' Singer Brent Faiyaz Is An Artist To Watch Out For">&larr;
