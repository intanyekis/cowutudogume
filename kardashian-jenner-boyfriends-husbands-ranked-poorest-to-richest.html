They hook up with guys, occasionally producing babies who are given celebrity-appropriate names like Stormi or True. Sometimes the guys are nice. Sometimes they are schemers and cheaters. For the most part, they come and go pretty quickly.</p><p>Most of the guys on this list are young and up-and-coming and run in the same circles as the infamous sisters. Some of them haven't had much money. But most of them are, like the Kardashian-Jenners, rolling in millions of dollars of net worth. So, let's take a look at 20 guys the sisters have dated and/or married and (sometimes) divorced. There's a lot of money on the list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated August 2023:</strong> The Kardashian and Jenner sisters have had their fair share of high-profile relationships over the years.
