A lot of emotions are involved, and there are times when people don’t exactly handle their emotions in the best ways. Jealousy is also a part of many romantic relationships. While a little bit of jealousy can be (kind of) healthy, such as not wanting your significant other to spend too much time talking to another man/woman, there are instances in which jealousy gets way out of control. If you’ve ever seen movies or documentaries about women or men killing their lovers, causing them harm, or stalking their ex’s new partner, you have a pretty good idea of the dangers of jealousy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, celebrities are not immune when it comes to the green-eyed monster. Sometimes it’s hard for celebrities to deal with the fact that their significant others have moved on. There are also times when these celebrities want to send a message to their lovers that total devotion is a requirement for the relationship. Of course, people have different reasons for being jealous, but taking the high road is usually best when you feel the urge to go into a jealous rage—whether you’re a celebrity or not.&nbsp;Here are 12 of Hollywood’s worst jealous rages.</p><h2 id=joseline-stevie-j>12. Joseline/Stevie J</h2><p>If you’re a fan of the <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> franchise, you’re likely familiar with couple <a href=#>Joseline Hernandez</a> and <a href=#>Stevie J</a>, who live in Atlanta. Hernandez is an aspiring singer, and she made it very clear to her producer husband Stevie J that she didn’t want him working with any other artists. According to TMZ, when Joseline found out that Stevie was working with singer <a href=#>Faith Evans</a> (Faith and Stevie have produced music together before), she decided to destroy $65,000 worth of his belongings, and she used bleach for much of the destruction process. It was reported that Stevie J also worked with <a href=#>Kanye West</a> recently, and Joseline didn’t seem to have a problem with that, so we’re guessing she just doesn’t want her husband to work with any other women. Joseline has also been known to have fits of rage on camera and has gotten into fights concerning Stevie J before, so we can’t say we’re too surprised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=joe-budden-audely>11. Joe Budden/Audely</h2><p>Rapper <a href=#>Joe Budden</a> has been in the news lately for his role in the <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> franchise, but has been trying to get his music career up and running. He’s likely not going to go very far in the business if he continues to gain a reputation for being a jealous, violent lover. He apparently was in a relationship with a bartender by the name of Audely. When Budden saw pictures of Audely with other men, he went to her NYC apartment, dragged her out of her residence, and allegedly choked her and banged her head against the dashboard. Many are asserting that Budden’s response to his jealousy was due to the fact that he’d started taking drugs again. Reports also stated that Budden drove Audely to his home in New Jersey, where he continued to beat her until cops arrived.</p><p></p><h2 id=kim-basinger-alec-baldwin>10. Kim Basinger/Alec Baldwin</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was a time when beautiful actress <a href=#>Kim Basinger</a> and <a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> were man and wife. When the couple divorced, it was a bitter process, and we’re pretty sure you remember the not-so-nice voicemail Baldwin left for his daughter Ireland, during the custody battle. Basinger, who allegedly has been “emotionally unstable” for quite some time, also went into a jealous rage when she found out that Baldwin was marrying a much younger woman in 2012. Basinger stated that she was afraid that Hilaria, Baldwin’s new wife, would drive a wedge between Basinger and her daughter. Kim has admitted that she suffers from agoraphobia and anxiety, which likely has a lot to do with her jealousy. Hilaria is also a former Latin dancer and teaches yoga that enhances sexual function, so this may have heightened Basinger’s anxiety.</p><p></p><h2 id=beyonce-jay-z>9. Beyonce/Jay-Z</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though we’ve seen more public displays of affection between superstar singer <a href=#>Beyonce</a> and her rapper/mogul husband <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>, the two still keep their relationship private for the most part. However, there have been rumors that Beyonce is jealous of Jay-Z’s relationship with Rihanna. Rihanna and Jay are supposedly just friends and have a brother/sister, boss/employee relationship, but there have long been rumors that the two are sleeping together. At one point, it was reported that Beyonce moved out of the couple’s home, and there were also reports that the two got into a huge fight at a restaurant when Jay was texting Rihanna for business reasons. There was also that “fight in the elevator” involving Jay-Z and <a href=#>Solange</a>, Beyonce’s younger sister. Some say they got into a fight because Jay wouldn’t stop flirting with Rihanna, and in the footage of the incident, Beyonce didn’t seem to be defending her husband at all. Interesting.</p><p></p><h2 id=charlie-sheen-denise-richards>8. Charlie Sheen/Denise Richards</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> has been known for his crazy antics much more than his acting these days. He was once married to actress <a href=#>Denise Richards</a>. While she was pregnant with the couple’s second child, she filed for divorce, because she couldn’t take living with Sheen any longer. She states that Charlie verbally abused her, and sent her a series of text messages calling her “talentless” and a “pig.” Nice. At the time, Denise was in the spotlight a little more than Charlie career-wise, so this may have had something to do with his tirade. Sheen is also known for objectifying women, and recently made it public that he is HIV-positive. Surprisingly, Richards states that the two are now friends.</p><p></p><h2 id=chris-brown-rihanna>7. Chris Brown/Rihanna</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most fans are familiar with <a href=#>Rihanna’s</a> bold presence, both in person and on social media. She makes it pretty clear when she’s mad at someone. <a href=#>Chris Brown</a>, Rihanna’s ex, has been known to “play the field” when it comes to dating, so some fans were surprised when he expressed jealousy that Rihanna was dating other people. The two, who have admittedly gotten into screaming matches before, engaged in a Twitter war at the end of their relationship in 2013, and Brown alluded to the fact that Rihanna couldn’t be “his” if she was “everybody else’s.” Brown also Tweeted that sometimes loving someone can be “too much” and that sometimes it’s best to love from a distance. Looks like Chris didn’t like the idea of dating around once the tables were turned.</p><p></p><h2 id=brad-pitt-angelina-jolie>6. Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie</h2><p>There have long been speculations that the relationship between <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and his wife <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>, has been wrought with jealousy. However, the two seem very much in love when they make public appearances, and haven’t given fans any indication that they are breaking up. However, there are reports that suggest that Brad Pitt has gone into a jealous rage before over of the fact that Jolie has a crush on <a href=#>Jared Leto</a>. Angelina and Jared used to date, which is probably why Brad takes her “crush” pretty seriously. A source who talked to In Touch Magazine stated that after Angelina ran into Jared at the 2014 Oscars, she couldn’t stop gushing over him. She commented on how good he looked and commented on his acting skills. This may explain why there are times when Jolie and Pitt attend events separately. If you study Brad’s body language at times, it’s easy to conclude that a jealous rage (in the privacy of his home) is likely imminent. There are also reports that Jolie was watching episodes of ex <a href=#>Jonny Lee Miller’s</a> show behind Pitt’s back, and that caused him to go into a jealous “rage” as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=jennifer-garner-ben-affleck>5. Jennifer Garner/ Ben Affleck</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> has a sweet and friendly image, and most people who have worked with the actress have nothing but good things to say about her. However, she wasn’t feeling particularly warm and fuzzy when she went into a fit of jealousy concerning husband <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>. A few years back, Garner allegedly learned that Affleck was still keeping in touch with <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>, his ex-fiance, and she lost it. Ben apparently made this information public, which definitely made Garner look bad. Reportedly, part of Garner’s jealous rage was booking a trip to Paris for her and her husband. She apparently decided that a romantic getaway would help her husband get his mind off Lopez. Looks like that didn’t work though, because Ben was recently accused of sleeping with the family’s nanny. There have been no reports of Garner having any jealous rages, so maybe she’s just fed up.</p><p></p><h2 id=portia-de-rossi>4. Portia de Rossi</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is believed that actress <a href=#>Portia de Rossi</a> is splitting from her wife, talk show host and comedienne <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>. Ellen hasn’t mentioned anything about this on her show, and she even had Portia on recently to “interview” her. But apparently, the gossip blogs are saying that DeGeneres has been unfaithful to de Rossi, and Portia has been in a jealous rage about it. Portia has apparently been losing her temper over the fact that Ellen and O’Neil have been going on lots of lunch dates together. Portia assumed Tatum was straight, until she stated that lately she’s been “dating mostly girls.” Reportedly, de Rossi has been bombarding Ellen with questions about her friendship with O’Neal. Interesting. The blogs are also saying that if Portia doesn’t get a hold of her jealous behavior, she could be putting her career in jeopardy.</p><p></p><h2 id=selena-gomez-orlando-bloom>3. Selena Gomez/Orlando Bloom</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> fans are glad that she’s finally gotten over <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> (or something like that). There are recent reports that Gomez started dating <a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a>, but the two are no longer together. Apparently, Selena went into a jealous rage when news broke that Bloom was dating model <a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>. Robert Downey, Jr. actually “spilled the beans” when he was presenting an award to Orlando for his work with UNICEF. <a href=#>Downey</a> stated that that Bloom was compassionate when he wasn’t “swinging at Justin Bieber or dating Kendall Jenner.” Selena apparently started dating Orlando Bloom because Justin Bieber had a fling with <a href=#>Miranda Kerr</a> (Bloom’s ex wife) a few years back. So, the Bloom/Gomez hook-up only happened to make Bieber jealous. Kendall and Selena were reportedly “feuding” because of this situation, even though Orlando stated that at the time, he’d never met Kendall, but “wouldn’t mind having her phone number.” We’re guessing the “rage” is going to continue to quite some time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=jada-pinkett-smith>2. Jada Pinkett-Smith</h2><p>There’s been a long-standing rumor in Hollywood that actress and musician <a href=#>Jada Pinkett-Smith</a> and her rapper/actor husband <a href=#>Will</a> are in an open marriage. However, that’s probably not the case (at least these days), since it’s been reported that Jada was pretty jealous of Will’s <i>Focus</i> co-star <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a>. Will stated in an interview that he and Robbie had really good chemistry as romantic interests in the movie, and there were reports that Jada was furious about the fact that Will and Margot were “all over each other” when they were doing press for their movie. Will also stated that Margot had a fabulous figure, which probably didn’t help Jada’s jealousy to subside, either.</p><p></p><h2 id=lisa-lopes-andre-rison>1. Lisa Lopes/Andre Rison</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The late Lisa “<a href=#>Left Eye” Lopes</a> was one third of the chart-topping R&B group TLC. Left Eye was the rapper of the group, and was known for her crazy style and outgoing personality. Lopes was also in the news pretty often for her relationship with <a href=#>Andre Rison</a>, who was a football player for the Atlanta Falcons. While the two were very much in love, they had their share of fights, and were often on-again, off-again. During one of Lopes’ fits of rage, she decided to set Rison’s Atlanta mansion on fire. We’re guessing Rison got the message that Lisa wouldn’t tolerate any infidelity. Surprisingly, the two actually got back together after the incident! Sadly, Lopes passed away in a car accident in 2002.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>tmz.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>intouchweekly.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>hollywoodlife.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>nationalenquirer.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>cbslocal.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnN51qiprKxdn7KiuM6uqmaqkZyytHnIp2Shp5yhxri7zp1m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-tv-shows-that-started-out-great-but-then-became-garbage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 TV Shows That Started Out Great But Then Became Garbage">&larr;
