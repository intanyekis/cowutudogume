We know that. In many of the examples on this list, the celebrities are actually struggling with a very serious disease. In each case, we will do our best to treat them respectfully. Having said that, we are using the potentially insensitive word "insane" here. Don't get yourself too worked up. It'll make you crazy. We also acknowledge that grouping flat out stupidity together with various abnormalities, mental illnesses, and other actual disabilities might also be insensitive to people. For that, we will apologize upfront. We are simply trying to find a catchall term to describe people whose mental state appears to be deteriorating. Finally, this is not a final statement on these stars. We have seen people go down a very mysterious path and come out the other side with a solid grasp on their mental state. It appears that <a href=#>Amanda Bynes</a> is in positive place currently. There's also <a href=#>Dave Chappelle</a> and <a href=#>Martin Lawrence</a> who, only a few years ago, might have made a list like this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping all that in mind, let's move forward. The limelight can be a dangerous place. We often see stars succumb to the pressures of the industry. They freak out, do some weird stuff, and the press all calls them whackos. Many cite exhaustion or drugs as the cause. Some are diagnosed with depression or as bipolar, others have deeper underlying issues that are never made public. Sadly, some celebs never get better. We're pulling for everyone on this list. We want them to get through whatever it is they're going through, but it doesn’t look good. In each, we are witnessing a slow but deliberate journey into madness, even if that might not be the right term. Here are 15 Celebrities Who Will (Probably) Be Totally Insane Within a Few Short Years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-carey><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></h2><p>Throughout her career, <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> has shown erratic behavior a number of times. There were hints early on, but in 2001, it all came to a head for the first time. This was when Carey was promoting her film,&nbsp;Glitter. She appeared in several strange interviews at the time. Though most people only remember the TRL one with the ice cream cart and Carson Daly, there were others which were just as weird. Not long after that, Carey was hospitalized for exhaustion. Though she has managed to avoid similar breakdowns on camera, the hint of mental illness hasn’t gone away. We had the New Years' show fiasco and her recent separation from her billionaire fiancé, James Packer, who claimed to have left because of Carey's unstable mind state.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mischa-barton><strong>Mischa Barton</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Mischa Barton</a> has shown difficulty dealing with fame and family in the past decade or so. Most of the issues came to light back in 2009 when, after going to the hospital for a tooth infection, she was involuntarily confined as a danger to herself and/or others. She must really hate the dentist. But seriously, this is what is called a '5150' under Californian law. Barton then accused her family of trying to defraud her and blames them for the hospitalization. It seemed that these issues were long gone, but in January of 2017, Barton was videotaped yelling and acting strangely in her backyard. Clearly under the influence, Barton had the police called on her by a neighbor. While Barton said later that she was drugged, it's the things she said in the video that we're interested in. Barton was heard yelling about her mother and other nonsense. Though she always has excuses afterward, it seems like her family issues haven’t been sorted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jake-lloyd><strong>Jake Lloyd</strong></h2><p>There were always hints of instability in <a href=#>Jake Lloyd</a>, the former child star, in interviews and the like. But it wasn't until the 2015 high-speed car chase and arrest that it all became clear. Lloyd has discussed his troubled childhood growing up in the public eye, and he basically grew to resent it. He spoke about how other kids mistreated him and it had lasting effects. About 10 months after his arrest, Lloyd was transferred out of jail and into a psychiatric ward. It was there that he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p><h2 id=sinead-o-connor><strong>Sinead O'Connor</strong></h2><p>We've known of <a href=#>Sinead O'Connor</a>'s mental health for some time. In 2003, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. We also learned that she tried to kill herself in the late '90s. The last few years have shown that O'Connor's mental state has only deteriorated further. She wrote a lengthy Facebook post in 2015 about overdosing and released a video in 2017 discussing her feelings of wanting to commit suicide all the time. The positive side of this all is that O'Connor is seeking help. The negative side is that its help is through Dr. Phil. She could and probably should get legitimate help from a real doctor and not one who uses farm metaphors to explain his thoughts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katt-williams><strong>Katt Williams</strong></h2><p>The last few years haven't been kind to <a href=#>Katt Williams</a>. The comedian has been in several fights in public, many of which were recorded to be distributed. The worst part was that these fights were mostly with women and children. We have watched this man's career unravel and his mind with it. One of his exes, Hazel-E, said of Williams, “I can’t be mad at him, it’s not him who acts this way, you under-dig me.” Back in 2008, Williams found himself in a psychiatric ward and rumors suggest that he's meant to be medicated but isn't currently. There have been anonymous emails posted online from, allegedly, those close to Williams that claim he is mentally unstable and needs help but refuses to take it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kanye-west><strong>Kanye West</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kanye West</a> has always been a very erratic person, but his rise to fame has ensured that his crazy got dialed up many more notches. Last year, people started talking when Kanye was hospitalized for exhaustion after ranting for 45 minutes during a show in Sacramento. He then cut the show short and cancelled the remaining dates on his tour. Now, Kanye has made a lot of money by acting wild and crazy, but lately, it's been different. He took plenty of time off over the course of the next several months to recuperate and is apparently doing better. But, when Kanye does crack, it will be because of our society. Kanye is a narcissistic megalomaniac. Because he has been so successful in his strange endeavors, people have labeled him as brilliant. Let's pull back the reins a bit here. All we're doing by crowning him god is giving him a bigger complex. That head is getting so large it's going to burst...soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-young><strong>Sean Young</strong></h2><p>You have to feel for <a href=#>Sean Young</a>. She was a giant star and faded magnificently. She blames the industry. Others blame it on her instability. While we tend to think there is much more to the story than meets the eye, Young has demonstrated, on a number of occasions, that she is not all there. It might have been the booze, sure, but she had some doozies. There was the harassment suit filed by <a href=#>James Woods</a> in the '80s. She allegedly left voodoo dolls and other creepy things outside his home. She then lost the role of Vicki Vale in <a href=#>Tim Burton</a>'s Batman because of an injury, so she campaigned for the Catwoman part by dressing up as the character on The Joan Rivers Show. She's been kicked out of Oscar parties and even arrested at the Governor's Ball. It's possible that she's stabilized some over the last few years, but we're not convinced just yet.</p><h2 id=terrence-howard><strong>Terrence Howard</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Terrence Howard</a> had a very rough childhood, so we can understand where his issues come from, but that does not excuse them. All these domestic abuse charges that surround Howard are insane, but they don't make him a madman. They only allow us not to feel bad by, once again, reminding everyone of this quote from Howard's Rolling Stone interview that prove he is insane in other ways:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A long time ago, he'd gotten hold of this notion that one times one doesn't equal one, but two. He began writing down his logic, in a language of his own devising that he calls Terryology. He wrote forward and backward, with both his right and left hands, sometimes using symbols he made up that look foreign, if not alien, to keep his ideas secret until they could be patented. In 2013, he got married again, to an L.A. restaurateur named Mira Pak, and the two would spend up to 17 hours a day cutting shapes out of the plastic and joining them together into various objects meant to demonstrate not only his one-times-one theory but many others as well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=randy-quaid><strong>Randy Quaid</strong></h2><p>It's been nearly a decade since <a href=#>Randy Quaid</a> last worked in Hollywood, and he may already be long gone mentally, but we've decided to include him because his fall from grace was monumental. In 2009, Quaid and his wife began to get in trouble. They fled hotel bills and were caught and arrested for squatting and missed court dates. Then, the Quaids fled to Canada. While everyone assumed they were running from their legal issues, they claimed it was because they feared for their lives. They were running from a group they called Hollywood Star Whackers. This is about when the couple started posting strange videos, something p*rnographic, online. They have been trying to convince the public of their plight, but it seems like no one is listening. We'll never see Quaid in Hollywood again, but we wonder if we'll ever see him totally sane again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marion-cotillard><strong>Marion Cotillard</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Marion Cotillard</a> is a phenomenal actress, but as we all know, actors can be a little "out there." Well, Cotillard might be the farthest out of them all. Having an opinion is everyone's right, but sometimes that right gets confused. Simply saying, I choose not to believe is not reason enough to ignore facts. Cotillard made headlines a couple of years ago when she stated that the World Trade Center's collapse was not possible. Now, she's obviously not the only crazed Truther in Hollywood, but she also stated that she did not really know what to think about the moon landing. Here's a refresher course, Cotillard. It happened. Accept it.</p><h2 id=b-o-b><strong>B.o.B</strong></h2><p>It's a little silly to conflate sheer stupidity with insanity, but here we go. When you're as oblivious as the rapper B.o.B. is, you might be interpreted as crazy. It's almost inevitable. This guy got on the topic of a flat Earth last year and he really committed to it. He started posting "proofs" of the flatness by showing his Twitter followers pictures of cities 16 miles apart. If you can't see a curve between them, he argued; that must mean the Earth is flat. Well, Bobby, considering the Earth is about 25,000 miles in circumference, 16 miles is a pretty small sample size. If you were a grain of sand on a beach ball, the ball would appear flat to you as well. It's all about perspective dear boy. Oh, and Mr. Bob isn’t convinced that the Earth is really rotating on its axis either. He refuses to accept that the astronauts in the space station are real. Basically, anything that refutes his stance is baloney in his eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=darrell-hammond><strong>Darrell Hammond</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Darrell Hammond</a> is best known for his many years on Saturday Night Live, but he is also a survivor of brutal abuse at the hands of his family. He revealed a few years ago that he has also suffered with mental health issues for many years. "(A supervising physician) had always heard about people like me but never actually treated people like me ... He goes, we're not equipped to handle you," Hammond said. "That's the first of several times: 'We don't --,' 'I can't --,' 'e're not,' 'we're just equipped for depressed people, not you,' which is a weird thing ... It made me ashamed." When discussing how those issues manifested themselves, Hammond said, "There was cutting backstage. In fact, the week that I did the Gore debates, I believe I was taken away in a straitjacket."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shirley-maclaine><strong>Shirley MacLaine</strong></h2><p>You'd be forgiven for not knowing that actress <a href=#>Shirely MacLaine</a> is batty. It's not discussed because it's ignored, but it's true. MacLaine believes in reincarnation. But that isn't the weird part. She believes that she was once a Buddhist monk. She also believes that she was once a peasant girl who slept with King Charlemagne the Great. She thinks that Charlemagne was reincarnated into Olaf Palme, the former Prime Minister of Sweden who she reconnected with in a later life. She also believes (or questions whether) many people who are suffering or have suffered are actually responsible for their own suffering. The Jewish people who were killed during the Holocaust? Why, they were possibly the Romans who killed Christians. <a href=#>Stephen Hawking</a> might also have been the person created "the disease that has crippled him." Slow down, Shirley, you're going to hurt yourself with all that thinking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=frankie-muniz><strong>Frankie Muniz</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Frankie Muniz</a> was on Dancing with the Stars, the actor revealed that he was suffering from, what sounds like, debilitating memory loss. He said, “Over the past 10 years, my mom will bring up things like trips we went on or big events and they are new stories to me… I don’t know what the cause of it is. It’s not something I looked into, I just thought it was how my brain is — so I thought it was normal. I didn’t know I should remember going to the Emmys when I was younger.” When asked what the doctors have said about it, Muniz said, “I’ve never been to the doctor and been like, you know, ‘Why don’t I have a memory?’ To be honest, I’ve never really talked about it.” Yeah, you should probably get that looked at, Frankie. This isn’t going to get any better by you ignoring it. There might be something that could stop this memory loss in its tracks. But Muniz states that he doesn't want to get help. "I’m not a doctor person," he said. "Every time I go to the doctors they just tell me I’m crazy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shelley-duvall><strong>Shelley Duvall</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Shelley Duvall</a> came onto the Dr. Phil show and began discussing her mental health, the show's host seemed to lead the actress on, trying to get her to discuss her delusions for entertainment purposes. This wasn't so <a href=#>Dr. Phil</a> could help; it was because he wanted ratings. At least, this is what many of his major critics have said, including the daughter of <a href=#>Stanley Kubrick</a>. It's clear that Duvall is suffering from severe mental illness. She has been in the news several times over the past year discussing this. We hope she gets the help she needs.</p><p>Sources: THR; Wikipedia; youtube; reddit; IMDB</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYsSquMtmp6unkpavrcWMm5xmrJ%2Bprq242Gagp6uRo7Juw8itn6KmXZZ6p7HWZqqhp6KperqxwKuqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./all-about-matteo-joel-nash-son-of-steve-nash.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Matteo Joel Nash, Son Of Steve Nash">&larr;
