Especially over something so seemingly silly — and not knowing that it’s going to pay off. We just would never do that. Especially with the entire cast — you’re really blowing up your relationship with everybody.”</p><p>According to Shannon, production would have guided Garcia into telling the truth if they knew ahead of time. “Had we known, we probably would have encouraged her much earlier on to have a come-to-Jesus with the ladies,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RHOSLC-Producers-Maintain-They-Had-No-Knowledge-of-Monica-Garcias-Connection-to-Reality-Von-Tease2.jpg><p>Fans and Garcia’s costars <a href=#>learned about her involvement</a> with Reality Von Tease during the season finale, which aired earlier this month, when <strong>Heather Gay</strong> was tipped off by her stylist <strong>Tenesha Luckett</strong> (who was also involved with the page).</p><p>While addressing the drama, Garcia maintained that the account was “never just one” person. “It wasn’t just me,” she told the cameras. “There were several other humans involved, but bottom line, our mission was to take down Jen. The other women were just collateral damage.”</p><p>Garcia has since been <a href=#>exiled from the other Housewives</a> and the three-part reunion did little to help.</p><p>“What I love about reunions is it’s like the Housewives’ court of law,” Cohen told Variety on Wednesday. “I think if Monica had come out and was able to sway even one of the women back on her side, it might be a different conversation right now.”</p><p>Hours before the final installment aired on Tuesday, January 23, news broke that Garcia <a href=#>wouldn’t be returning to the show</a>. Cohen confirmed the cast shakeup during Watch What Happens Live that same night but he called Garcia’s absence from season 5 “a break.”</p><p>“The whole franchise is based on friends, and people who know each other and circulate in the same circles. And at this time, the women just need a cooling off period,” Gordon added to Variety. “And I think it’s too soon — they’ve articulated it. It’s too soon for them to reenter into a friendship, a trusting friendship. Not enough time has passed.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The production team <a href=#>isn’t ruling out a return</a> for Garcia in the future. “Who knows?” Cohen quipped on Wednesday. “Anything can happen. And I love a comeback. And so it would be very cool to find a path forward for her.”</p><p>Gay said she was relieved by the decision, adding, “Monica has no connection with any of us right now. There’s no chance that she will be in my home, in my business, or around me anytime soon.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is set to start filming season 5 in early February.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp6OhsG680aibrpuVp8BusMSnsGajnqTEqrrGZqSoppmYrm6zwKuaopldp66vedGemKWhpK56t7vNZquemaOafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bella-thorne-is-so-weird-15-reasons-shes-the-next-amanda-bynes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bella Thorne Is So Weird! 15 Reasons She's The Next Amanda Bynes">&larr;
