I don’t feel like myself. I don’t feel attractive. I feel like I’m only good for making a baby,” Stassi, who’s expecting her first child with her husband <strong>Beau Clark</strong>, wrote over the vulnerable selfie.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I feel like I have zero control over anything. I’m uncomfortable and it’s painful to move around,” Stassi continued. “And my emotions are so all over the place, I feel insane. I’ve received lots of dm’s from people telling me I complain too much and should shut up and just be thankful I’m pregnant.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>However, Stassi made it clear that she’s grateful for the child she’s carrying: “I’ve never been more thankful for anything. Being a mother was my biggest dream and I can’t wait to meet my daughter. But I’m still allowed to struggle with it. Why is there so much pressure on pregnant women to be super heroes?

The message she shared was in response to Billie’s body shaming situation and she made sure to remind others that the singer is “human” just like everyone else. “The lows we have stooped to when we are bullying an 18 year old pop star about her body, forgetting that not only is she human, but there are children watching our behavior internalizing our words against themselves and others, learning from you how to make this world uglier,” the tweet read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19><span style="font-family:Playfair Display"><span style=font-size:30px><b><i>Jessica Simpson</i></b></span></span></p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-20></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by Jessica Simpson (@jessicasimpson)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-21></p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Jessica spoke out against body shamers when she was body shamed herself for her 2007 Met Ball look.

The British beauty shared a bikini photo of herself that showed off her behind and captioned it with a lengthy message about the natural aspects of a woman’s body. “yeah that’s a booty and yeah it’s got some cellulite aka 🐯⚡️ tiger stripes,” she wrote in the caption before touching upon how “perfection” is “not real.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>“We don’t need to be airbrushed to ‘perfection’ it’s not real. We are more than our bodies,” she continued. “I now know my happiness comes from my loved ones my adventures travelling and learning about the world. Not by trying to live upto societies unrealistic ideals but being grateful for who I am, my health & enjoying each day.

Feel the sand between your toes and smell the ocean, and remember those things.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-35>“So anything that anyone’s ever told you that you’re not worthy, you are worthy of experiencing that in whatever you want to wear,” she continued. “It’s about you being able to live your fullest life no matter what.

In a caption for a Mar. 2018 Instagram post, which included a video of her and her friends on a boat, she wrote an inspirational message about body image. “<span>The beauty myth- an obsession with physical perfection that traps modern woman in an endless cycle of hopelessness, self consciousness, and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society’s impossible definition of flawless beauty,” the caption read. “I chose to take care of myself because I want to, not to prove anything to anyone.
