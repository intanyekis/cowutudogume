But there has been no photographic evidence of that and there has been no confirmation of weight loss from herself. Emily Compagno supposedly follows a strict diet and exercise plan to stay fit.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Emily Compagno</strong></a> is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>television host</strong></a> who currently serves as a contributor on Fox News Channel (FNC). She also happens to be the co-host of Outnumbered, and frequently appears on the late-night show Gutfeld!. Besides all that, she is also an attorney and a former <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>National Football League</strong></a> (NFL) cheerleader.</p><p>Compagno was born in East Oakland's Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, Oakland California, and raised in El Cerrito, California. She was born as the daughter of <strong>Katherine</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>John Compagno</strong>. Her father is of Italian descent. Her great-grandfather <strong>William Harry Bertsch</strong> earned the Silver Star during World War I. She has two sisters.</p><p>Emily Compagno obtained a B.A. in political science from the University of Washington where she was also awarded the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps' Cadet of the Quarter Award. She also went to the University of San Francisco School of Law from which she graduated with a J.D. in 2006.</p><p>Fans are currently talking about his weight loss and want to know what kind of diet and exercises they follow. Let's learn more about Emily Compagno's weight loss, diet, and exercises!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a></strong> efforts of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jeff Saturday</strong></a>.</p><h2>Emily Compagno's Weight Loss: Details of Diet and Exercises The Television Host Follows!</h2><p><strong>Emily Compagno</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@realemilycompagno</a>) is rumored to have undergone significant weight loss.</p><p>Every time Emily Compagno comes into the <a href=# rel=noopener>spotlight for whatever reason</a>, one of the things that people get curious to know about her is her weight loss which is kind of strange because she has never been a huge girl and hasn't had any major physical transformations to speak of. But still, her body transformation is a topic that keeps on getting repeated.</p><p>Anyway, about her weight loss, it has been reported by various websites that she has indeed lost weight in the last two years as she appears to be much slimmer than before. Apparently, she looked much heavier before, and compared to then, her weight seems to have changed significantly. However, there are no photo proofs of that as every picture of her looks the same without any differences, especially when it came to weight.</p><p>Besides, it's not just Emily Compagno's images that are useless to prove she has had weight loss but it's herself as well because if she had spoken about it herself, we could be sure of it. But, she herself has never once mentioned going on a journey to lose weight, never ever talked about what kind of diet she had and what kind of exercises she did. That could mean that this weight loss thing could be false as well.</p><p>But some people refuse to believe that and think that Emily Compagno's weight loss could not be seen properly and is not very visible because she is a tall person and in people with such a body frame as hers, changes in weight might not be much noticeable.</p><p>Some fans think that the Outnumbered host maintains a healthy lifestyle to stay physically fit. She does look fit in her most recent Instagram pictures but if fans meant that she followed a special diet and exercise routine to shed weight, then the special diet and exercises have been super vague to talk of.</p><p>There are others who think that Emily Compagno is sick and bears some kind of illness, the stress of which is caused her to be unhealthy that has made her lose weight. But, it does not appear like that and it seems that she is in very good health.</p><h2>Emily Compagno's Career: From Being a Cheerleader to Being a Television Host!</h2><p><strong>Emily Compagno</strong> has come a long way since her cheerleading days.
