People have been accusing her of being everything from narcissistic to dishonest. The actress has been the target of countless memes, and the internet has dubbed her an attention-seeker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recent allegations that the actress has a history of aggressive behavior and that she fork-stabbed her co-star and supposedly “close friend” James Franco during the filming of Pineapple Express have further damaged her reputation. Did Amber really stab him?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>If Amber Heard Can’t Pay Johnny Depp, Will He Take Her Back To Court?</a></span></p><h2 id=amber-heard-allegedly-stabbed-james-franco-on-set>Amber Heard Allegedly Stabbed James Franco On Set</h2><p>After all was said and done in the defamation case involving Amber Heard and Johnny Depp, there are still those who assert that Amber has a violent past. Some even assert that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she fork-stabbed James Franco</a>, an actor and supposedly "close friend," in the stoner film Pineapple Express during an unplanned scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the Judd Apatow movie, Amber plays Angie Anderson, Dale’s (Seth Rogen) ex-girlfriend and love interest. In the most chaotic scene of the film where Saul (James Franco) comes in, she panics and stabs Saul with a fork around the shoulder area. Rumors suggest that the scene was not scripted.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Amber Heard Has A Wild Reason For Appealing The Defamation Verdict</a></span></p><p>However, the movie’s script revealed that it was completely scripted and the allegations suggesting otherwise are not true. Amber was asked to act like she was stabbing James with a fork. Unfortunately, that scene from the movie is now going viral – with some still accusing the actress of being a violent person.</p><h2 id=amber-heard-speaks-out-against-internet-bullying>Amber Heard Speaks Out Against Internet Bullying</h2><p>While it is true that she didn’t fork-stab her ex-boyfriend James Franco, and it was all part of the film, fans have been trolling her relentlessly online. While siding with Johnny Depp, netizens have indicted her of being an abuser in her marriage with the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It can be remembered that Amber accused Johnny of domestic violence in her 2018 The Washington Post op-ed. Nevertheless, several fans believed that she was the abuser in the relationship after evidence brought into court that showed her lifting her hand against Johnny.</p><p>Since then, many wondered whether Amber has been abusive in her workplace as well. That’s the reason why that certain scene in Pineapple Express went viral. Netizens have villainized the actress on social media. <a href=#>Speaking about the online bullying and hate</a>, she told Savannah Guthrie her thoughts in an exclusive interview with NBC â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She explained, “I don’t care what one thinks about me or what judgments you want to make about what happened in the privacy of my own home, in my marriage, behind closed doors. I don’t presume the average person should know those things. And so I don’t take it personally.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Amber Heard’s Insurance Company Refuses To Cover $8M Damages As Her Claims Were ‘Malicious’</a></span></p><p>“But even somebody who is sure I’m deserving of all this hate and vitriol, even if you think I’m lying, you still couldn’t tell me – look me in the eye and tell me – that you think on social media there’s been a fair representation. You cannot tell me that you think that this has been fair,” she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking about Amber Heard’s motivation to appear in the interview</a>, a spokesperson for the actress said, “Johnny Depp’s legal team blanketed the media for days after the verdict with numerous statements and interviews on television, and Depp himself did the same on social media. Ms. Heard simply intended to respond to what they aggressively did last week; she did so by expressing her thoughts and feelings, much of which she was not allowed to do on the witness stand.”</p><h2 id=amber-heard-faces-accusations-of-being-narcissistic>Amber Heard Faces Accusations Of Being Narcissistic</h2><p>After sharing her side of the story, netizens showed no sympathy towards the actress. Many did not like the fact that she came forward for an interview following her legal loss. They believe that Amber appeared in the show simply to seek attention for herself. They were even displeased to hear her speak about the hate she received online.</p><p>Several people stated that the internet did not deem her guilty in the defamation trial, but the jury voted in favor of Johnny Depp. A social media user explained on Twitter, “Social Media doesn’t decide the verdict. People started supporting Johnny before you even got on the stand and even more so afterwards. Get over yourself.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, a Twitter user wrote, “She just loves to tell us what to think. This is why she is not liked. She wants to control everything. If you’re not liked then maybe ask yourself WHY. Continually shoving yourself infront of the spotlight and trying to gaslight everyone will not help.”</p><p>Another commented, “Amber Heard: ‘I just wanted Johnny to leave me alooone..’ Also Amber: ‘Look at me!! I need to lie some more because I’m an abusive narcissist that can’t leave my victim alone!!’” while one shared, “The Depp team proved she lied. They are seeing the media continuing to support her in spite of that. The one not treated fairly is Johnny.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amber Heard is unlikely to gain any positive response from the public anytime soon, especially after she claimed in the NBC interview that Johnny Depp won only because of his fame. But there are <a href=#>some who think she is telling the truth</a> because she has ‘nothing to gain’ from it. Only time will tell how things will go for the actress, but it is clear that things will never be the same again in the future.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What’s Next For Johnny Depp After The Amber Heard Trial?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlrqjsdFmn56Zopl6s7HApaOyZaOprqN5yZqknqtdm7%2BiusKoZKmhnpqusbzLnmSesKCnsrS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-paloma-jimenez-gay-sexuality-rumors-on-vin-diesel-partner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Paloma Jimnez Gay?
