While there are a few good vegan delta 8 gummies on the market who use pectin instead, Binoid Premium Delta 8 Gummies are our pick due to the variety of yummy flavors, including: peach dream, strawberry blitz and sour green apple — with each canister containing 20 gummies.</p><p>These 100% vegan gummies contain 25 mg delta 8 THC each.

They are equipped to grow and change with the delta-8 industry.</p><h2>How We Chose Our Winners</h2><p>Selecting our favorite delta 8 gummies was actually a lot of fun, and we certainly learned a lot about the industry. It quickly became clear that a few key qualities set the gummies on our list apart from their competitors.</p><h3>Lab Testing</h3><p>Third party lab testing was a must for us. We only featured products that have been tested for purity and potency. Testing for potency ensures that these gummies contain as much delta 8 as the label claims they do. Lab testing for purity ensures they don’t contain pesticide residue, heavy metals, and other unwanted substances.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>The best delta 8 companies, we found, are happy to tell customers where they get their hemp. They’re proud to work with top-quality hemp farms. We also chose gummies made with high-quality inactive ingredients. Many of the products on this list are vegan, non-GMO and organic. Those that are not vegan are still made with responsibly sourced ingredients.</p><h3>Positive Customer Experiences</h3><p>We chose gummies that made us feel relaxed and eased our pain. However, we also cared what other people said about them. After reading countless reviews, we narrowed down our list to delta 8 gummies that received primarily rave reviews from other customers.</p><h3>Extras</h3><p>If we still had trouble making a decision after considering lab testing, ingredients, and customer experiences, we looked at the “extra” qualities that a gummy had to offer. These were things like offering multiple flavors, multiple package sizes, and a variety of doses.</p><h2>What Is Delta 8, Exactly?</h2><p>Delta 8 is a cannabinoid — an active compound produced by a cannabis plant. Other cannabinoids you may be more familiar with include CBD and CBN.</p><p>“Delta 8” is actually shorthand for delta 8 THC. Indeed, this is a form of THC, the cannabinoid that is well known for its psychoactive properties. However, delta 8 is a different form of THC than the one you hear about most often. The better known type of THC is technically known as delta 9 THC.</p><p>Delta 8 THC is quite similar to delta 9 THC, at least on a chemical level. Delta 9 THC simply has a double bond in a different spot than delta 8 THC.</p><h3>What Are The Effects of Delta 8?</h3><p>Delta 8 THC has similar effects to those of delta 9 THC. However, the effects of delta 8 tend to be milder. After taking delta 8 THC, most people feel relaxed and euphoric. The substance can also relieve aches, pains, and discomfort. Like delta 9 THC, delta 8 THC can cause you to develop the munchies and food cravings. These effects are more pronounced at higher doses.</p><h3>Is Delta 8 THC Legal?</h3><p>In the United States, it is legal to grow hemp plants that contain less than 0.3% delta 9 THC. Some of these plants contain higher proportions of delta 8 THC. As long as they are under 0.3% delta 9 THC, they are legal to grow and use. Thereby, delta 8 THC is federally legal in the U.S. as long as it is obtained from legal, compliant hemp.</p><p>Delta 8 is also legal in most U.S. states. However, there are a few states that do not allow the sale of delta 9 products. These states include Vermont, Utah, Idaho, Iowa and Montana. Some other states — including Connecticut, Michigan and Nevada — regulate delta 8 the same way they regulate recreational cannabis products.</p><h2>Taking Delta 8 For the First Time</h2><p>Everyone reacts a little differently to delta 8 THC. So, it is important to clear your schedule and make sure you’re in a relaxing environment the first time you take delta 8 gummies.</p><h3>The Perfect Dose</h3><p>The first time you take delta-8, start with a <a href=# rel=noopener>small dose</a> between 5 and 15 mg. Some gummies contain just 10 mg delta 8 per serving. If you have these low-dose gummies, you can take either half or a whole gummy your first time around. If you have a higher-dose gummy, such as a 25 mg gummy, you definitely want to take half a gummy your first time.</p><p>You may not start to feel the effects of the gummy until an hour after you take it. So, don’t panic and take more if you’re not feeling the effects. Wait it out, and see how you feel. If the effects are not strong enough, you can take a higher dose the next time you use delta-8.</p><h3>The Effects</h3><p>Most people start to feel the effects of delta 8 about 30 to 60 minutes after taking a gummy. Sometimes, you may not feel the full effects for up to 2 hours. At first, you may just feel a little more relaxed and less stressed than usual. Then, you may find yourself overcome by a feeling of euphoria and pleasantness. Some people start feeling more energized at this point, and others start to feel sleepy.</p><p>Don’t be alarmed if you start to feel hungry after taking delta 8. This is a normal effect of the substance and a reason why cancer patients often use delta 8 for appetite stimulation. Grab your favorite snack, and enjoy.</p><p>Delta 8 can also help relieve pain. An hour or so after taking it, you may find that your pain starts to diminish. You’ll also find yourself less distracted or bothered by your pain.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>effects of delta 8 THC</a> can last up to 10 hours in some cases, but most people find they wear off in about 5 hours.</p><h2>The Benefits of Delta 8</h2><p>Delta 8 THC is often a good choice for those who don’t get enough relief from CBD. It also works well for those seeking something a bit milder and less potent than delta 9 THC.</p><p>Here are some more specific health benefits of delta 8:</p><h3>Better Sleep</h3><p>Do you have trouble drifting off to sleep due to an overactive mind or anxiety? Delta 8 may help. Its relaxing, sedating effects can help you doze off. If you are taking delta 8 specifically to help you sleep, then you may want to look for gummies formulated with CBD. When used together, CBD and delta 8 deliver powerful relief from insomnia.</p><h3>Anxiety Relief</h3><p>Maybe you feel anxious in social settings. Or perhaps your heart starts racing when you think about everything you have to do the next day. Anxiety can be a real bummer, but delta 8 can help. Some people take it daily to help keep their anxiety in check. Others only take it prior to specific situations that they know will be anxiety-inducing.</p><h3>Pain Relief</h3><p>More and more, people are seeking alternatives to opiates and other prescription pain relievers. Delta 8 can be a good choice because it is natural, non-addictive, and relatively affordable. Some people use delta 8 gummies to ease arthritis pain. It can also be a good antidote to headaches, menstrual cramps, post-exercise muscle soreness, and toothaches.</p><h3>Appetite Stimulation</h3><p>Like its more potent cousin, delta 9 THC, delta 8 THC can give you the munchies. While many users simply view this as a fun side effect, it can actually be a benefit for those who have a reduced appetite. Delta 8 can help cancer patients continue eating as they navigate through treatment. It can also be helpful for those struggling with eating disorders or food aversions.</p><h2>Potential Side Effects of Delta 8</h2><p>Delta 8 THC can cause side effects. Thankfully, these side effects are generally temporary, and they wear off within a few hours once the delta 8 is out of your system. Often, taking a smaller dose of delta 8 will keep you from developing side effects the next time around. Here are the most common side effects people report when using delta 8 THC.</p><h3>Red Eyes</h3><p>Like many cannabis products, delta-8 can make your eyes dry and red. If this happens to you, resist the urge to rub your eyes. Instead, use lubricating eye drops. The eye drops will replace your tears, soothing your eyes and taking away a lot of the redness. Some people need to use eye drops every hour or two when taking delta 8 THC.</p><h3>Dry Mouth</h3><p>Dry mouth is another delta 8 side effect that’s more annoying than anything. If you’re struggling with dry mouth, try sipping water every couple of minutes. Chewing sugar-free gum can also help.</p><p>If you are a regular delta 8 user, you may want to look into toothpastes designed to increase saliva production. These can be good for your long-term <a href=# rel=noopener>dental health</a> since dry mouth can increase your risk of cavities and gum disease over time.</p><h3>Anxiety</h3><p>Delta 8 can help treat anxiety, but sometimes, people start feeling overly anxious after taking it. This almost always means you have taken too much delta 8. The next time you take it, use a much smaller dose.</p><p>If you do start to feel anxious after taking delta 8, here are some ways to calm your anxiety.</p><ul><li aria-level=1>Take some CBD. It helps counteract the effects of delta-8.</li><li aria-level=1>Focus on taking deep breaths, filling your lungs from the bottom to the top.</li><li aria-level=1>Watch a movie or TV show that you know makes you feel happy and relaxed.</li></ul><h3>Impaired Coordination</h3><p>Many people find that taking delta 8 impairs their coordination to some extent. This is why it’s never wise to operate machinery or drive a car when under the influence of delta-8.</p><h2>FAQs:</h2><h3>How much delta 8 do I need to take?</h3><p>The ideal dose varies from person to person. If you are new to delta 8, have a low body weight, or have a slow metabolism, you may need to take less delta 8 than the average person. Most people are safe starting with a dose of 5 to 15 mg of delta 8 when taking it orally. If you find this is not enough, you can take a higher dose next time. Experienced users and those with higher body weights often find a dose of 20-40 mg to be sufficient.</p><p>You may need to take more delta -8 if you’re taking it for pain relief versus relaxation.</p><h3>How is delta 8 different from CBD?</h3><p>CBD and delta 8 have some of the same effects. They can both help you relax and fall asleep. They are both good for pain relief. However, delta 8 is a psychoactive substance, and CBD is not. While it is generally safe to drive or operate machinery after taking CBD, you should not do these things after taking delta 8 THC.</p><h3>Does delta 8 make you high?</h3><p>Yes, delta 8 can make you feel high, especially at higher doses. It is not as psychoactive as delta-9 THC, but it does cause some degree of cognitive distortion and impairment. If you do not want to feel high, you may wish to take CBD instead of delta 8. Or, you could try taking a smaller dose of delta 8. At smaller doses, such as 5 mg or 10 mg, delta 8 is less psychoactive but can still help ease stress.</p><h3>How long does it take delta 8 to kick in?</h3><p>If you take delta 8 orally, you will usually start to feel the effects within 30 minutes to an hour. However, you may not feel the full effects for up to 2 hours.</p><p>If you want to feel the effects of delta 8 sooner, you can try taking delta 8 with a snack that contains fat. The fat helps enhance and speed up the absorption of the delta 8. Or, you may want to try vaping delta 8 instead of taking delta-8 gummies. When you vape delta-8, the effects develop within minutes.</p><h3>Can you overdose on delta 8?</h3><p>It is technically not possible to <a href=# rel=noopener>overdose on delta 8</a>. There is no dose at which this substance will kill you or have serious, lasting health consequences. However, people do experience unpleasant effects, such as paranoia and anxiety, if they take too much delta 8. To avoid these unpleasant effects, always start with a low dose of delta 8 and work your way up.</p><p>If you do take more delta 8 than intended, try taking some CBD to counteract the effects. CBD can help counteract the paranoia and confusion you may be feeling. Eating a snack can help, too.</p><p>To minimize your risk of taking too much delta-8, it is also important to buy from reputable companies that lab-test their products for potency. Products that are not lab-tested may contain more delta 8 than they claim, which makes it easier for you to accidentally take more than you intended.</p><p>Delta 8 is a beneficial cannabinoid that is federally legal in the United States and in most U.S. states. It can help you relax, and it can combat pain and anxiety. Delta 8 gummies provide a convenient and tasty way for you to get your desired dose of delta 8 THC. The 9 top delta 8 gummy products we’ve listed above are truly the best available. Give them a try — and embrace the power of cannabis.</p><p>Still haven’t found what you’re looking for?
