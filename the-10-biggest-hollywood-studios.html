This means that certain companies controlled practically the entire process of filmmaking, from production to distribution and exhibition. There were eight studios then, with five having fully integrated conglomerates, with a production studio, creative people under long-term exclusive contracts, distribution division and a wide network of theater chains. These five studios were 20th Century Fox, Loew’s Incorporated/MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO Radio Pictures and Warner Bros. There were three other companies that were considered to be major studios, namely Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures and United Artists, though they had substantially smaller theater chains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These came to an end in 1948 when the set up was challenged in the Supreme Court under anti trust laws. Production was thereafter separated from distribution and exhibition.</p><p>Still, the term studio system is being used up to now as reference to the outputs of the different companies. Here is a list of the ten biggest Hollywood studios. The top six are considered to be the major studios, while the last four, along with Relativity Media and Dreamworks Animation, are considered as mini-majors that compete directly with the majors, though they also sometimes work together to help with the distribution of home videos and in the foreign market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=10-dreamworks><b>10. Dreamworks</b></h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenburg and David Geffen established Dreamworks in 1994. Though not a full-service studio, Dreamworks arranges for the production and financing of movies. It then ties up with one of the majors for help in the distribution. It actually had a brief stint as part of the Viacom group, but it became independent again after over two years. The Reliance ADA Group of India currently backs the company. Katzenburg has since completely divested from the company and now runs a separate studio called Dreamworks Animation.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2 id=9-mgm><b>9. MGM</b></h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>MGM has downgraded itself from being a major studio into a minor media company that distributes films and television content. It fully owns United Artists after it bought out the shares of Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. It still owns the rights to the franchise of the James Bond movies. Its home video and overseas theatrical products are distributed by 20th Century Fox. Columbia Pictures, on the other hand, has helped distribute the first two Bond movies that starred Daniel Craig, with its mother company Sony helping out in subsequent releases.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2 id=8-the-weinstein-company><b>8. The Weinstein Company</b></h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harvey and Bob Weinstein established The Weinstein Company in 2005 after leaving Miramax Films, which they had helped establish in 1979. It holds the right to Dimension Films, an outfit that the brothers regularly use for genre movies. While it had a hit back in 2007 with the movie called “1408,” it then experienced a dry spell of two years without scoring a blockbuster. Their long relationship with Quentin Tarantino has helped the outfit turn around its fortunes, with the success of the director’s 2009 movie “Inglourious Basterds” considered as a watershed moment for the company.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2 id=7-lions-gate-entertainment><b>7.
