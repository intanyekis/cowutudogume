Some of Mahomes' comments include a jab at her songwriting. "Taylor swift... I wanna know when your gonna find something different to write about besides boys and relationships... #timeforsomethingnew," she wrote in 2012.</p><p>As for how Swift reacted? A source reportedly told Life & Style, "Taylor wasn't happy ... She's used to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people saying nasty things</a> about her, but this was <a href=#>someone she's welcomed into her squad</a>." It was reported that Mahomes had apologized in private. "Brittany explained to Taylor that she was just a stupid teenager and how sorry she was," the source claims. "Taylor was very understanding and decided to just let bygones be bygones." It is worth noting that Mahomes was just 18 when she made the tweets, and many people have been known to say or do something they would later regret at this age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is also known that their respective partners, <strong>Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are very good friends</strong>, and if the report is to be believed, this could be one of the reasons Swift chose to forgive Brittany quickly. "Travis and Patrick are very tight," the source claims, adding, "Taylor's not going to do anything that would put Travis in an awkward spot."</p><p>Despite the reports, it appears Swift is not bothered because the couples enjoyed their time at Easy's Cocktail Lounge. According to TMZ, the spot is "a bit more secluded, tucked away inside the Proper Eats Food Hall in the hotel," and the friends "were quite successful in keeping their night low-key."</p><h2 id=what-have-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-been-doing-in-their-downtime>What Have Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Been Doing In Their Downtime?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-12.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce</a> both have demanding work schedules, but they have been spending as much time together as possible when they can.
