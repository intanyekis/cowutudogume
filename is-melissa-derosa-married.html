She’s not just any political figure, but a former government official who held a significant position in the administration of the former Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo. But beyond her career in politics, there’s a personal side to Melissa DeRosa that we’re going to explore in this article. Is Melissa DeRosa married? Who was her husband? What’s her relationship status now? Let’s take a closer look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Melissa-Derosa-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Melissa_Derosa></span><strong>Who Is Melissa Derosa?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Melissa DeRosa is an American former government official who served as the Secretary to the former Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, from 2017 until 2021. She is a member of the Democratic Party and is known for her role as a political advisor and strategist. In addition to her political career, Melissa DeRosa is also the author of a memoir titled “What’s Left Unsaid: My Life at the Center of Power, Politics & Crisis,” which was published in October 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Melissa_DeRosa.jpg><p>DeRosa’s political journey began in New York, where she grew up, and she hails from a family with political influence, as her father was a powerful lobbyist. She started her career in politics as an intern for the New York State AFL-CIO and worked on Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign. Later, she held positions as a congressional press secretary and as the deputy chief of staff in the office of New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.</p><p>In 2013, Melissa DeRosa joined the administration of Governor Andrew Cuomo and rapidly climbed the ranks. She served as his communications director and chief of staff before being appointed as Secretary to the Governor in 2017. In this role, she became one of Cuomo’s most trusted advisors and was responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of his office.</p><p>However, in August 2021, DeRosa resigned from her position as Secretary after the New York State Attorney General released a report that found Governor Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women, nine of whom were his employees. The report also revealed that DeRosa had been involved in efforts to retaliate against and discredit one of Cuomo’s accusers.</p><p>Following her resignation, Melissa DeRosa became a vocal advocate for survivors of sexual harassment and assault. She has also shared her own experiences as a woman in a position of power. Currently, she is a contributor to The Daily Beast and 77 WABC Radio.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Melissa_Derosa_Marriage_to_Matthew_Wing></span><strong>Melissa Derosa</strong> <strong>Marriage to Matthew Wing</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/melissa-derosa-matt-wing-1-899x1024.jpg><p>Melissa DeRosa was married to Matthew Wing, who served as a senior communications officer at Uber. Their story began back in 2013 when they both worked for Governor Cuomo. At the time, DeRosa was the communications director, and Wing was a press secretary. Love blossomed in the world of politics, and they decided to tie the knot in 2016.</p><p>Their union brought an interesting family connection into the mix. Melissa DeRosa’s mother-in-law is Audrey Strauss, who held the prestigious position of United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2020 to 2021. It’s not every day that you have such a high-powered family network.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Strains_in_the_Marriage></span><strong>The Strains in the Marriage</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In her memoir titled “What’s Left Unsaid: My Life at the Center of Power, Politics & Crisis,” Melissa DeRosa opens up about the challenges she and Matthew Wing faced during their marriage. She candidly reveals that the demanding world of politics took a toll on their relationship. Long hours and intense workloads became significant stressors, causing them to grow apart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/melissa-derosa-lists-NYC-apartment1.webp><p>As Secretary to the Governor of New York, DeRosa had a pivotal role in managing the day-to-day operations of the Cuomo administration. Her responsibilities were vast, and the pressure was intense. Balancing such a high-powered career with family life can be incredibly challenging, and it’s a struggle that many working professionals can relate to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Melissa_Derosa_Divorce></span><strong>Melissa Derosa Divorce</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/13MELISSADEROSA-1-SUB-superJumbo-1024x1024.jpg><p>The strains on their marriage eventually led to a separation. In October 2021, shortly after Melissa DeRosa resigned from her position as Secretary to the Governor, she and Matthew Wing announced their separation. This was undoubtedly a difficult decision for them both, but it highlighted the toll that a demanding career in politics can take on personal relationships.</p><p>The separation process continued as they sold their Brooklyn Heights apartment in 2022. And by March 2023, their divorce was finalized. Going through a divorce is never easy, and it’s a time of significant change and adjustment for both parties involved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Melissa_Derosa_Current_Relationship_Status></span><strong>Melissa Derosa</strong> <strong>Current Relationship Status</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/download-76.jpg><p>Melissa DeRosa has kept her current relationship status relatively private. Since her divorce, she hasn’t made any public comments regarding her romantic life.
