It's mostly due to the fact that she is part of the Kardashian family, is a top model, and has excellent taste, but also because of her dominating social media presence. She is an influencer on another level. She uses social media <a href=#>(mainly Instagram, where she gets paid quite well)</a> to share glimpses of her wardrobe with followers. It might be a red carpet look, matching outfits, or a photo shoot. She is notorious for wearing sought after clothes from high-end fashion labels and for her love of shoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenner has worked with a lot of sportswear companies over the years to sell her own designs and collections.

Outside contracted hours, though? Kylie Jenner loves her Nikes. Even her beautiful children get cute little Nikes!

The famous sneaker is reimagined by designer Kim Jones using an Italian leather upper in white and grey with hand-painted edges. A Dior stitched tongue, a Nike Swoosh in Dior Oblique jacquard, and ice outsoles that show a Dior Wings emblem on each shoe are evidence of the dual branding touches. The Dior x Air Jordan 1 High is a limited edition sneaker that was released in April 2020, and it quickly became one of the most sought-after sneakers of the year. With only 8,500 pairs made, the shoe is a rare find for sneakerheads and fashion enthusiasts alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-39-s-ozweego-adidas-sneakers><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kylie Jenner's Ozweego Adidas Sneakers</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/adidas-originals-women-s-ozweego-sneaker.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Adidas Ozweego Sneakers</a></strong></p><p>Because of their sculpted Adiprene cushioning and fluid lines, these Adidas OZWEEGO shoes are eye-catching wherever you go.
