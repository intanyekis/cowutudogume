One of the less welcome ones ‚Äî stretching back over many years ‚Äî is their apparent habit of leaving themselves short of options at left-back.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span>But when faced with that exact potential issue, largely because of the hairline fracture in Omar Richards‚Äô leg, the response of the current hierarchy has been to sign a player who, if he does well in the coming months, has a reasonable chance of starting on the left side of defence for Brazil at the World Cup this winter.</span></p><p><span>No more faded Leyton Orient old boys, Argentine journeymen from QPR or a bemused James Perch being asked to fill in at left-back in a Championship play-off semi-final, <a href=#>as Davies seemingly tried to make a point.</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Instead, Forest have signed a player who in the past has been the subject of interest from Newcastle United, Manchester City and Juventus. Somebody who, for the past three years, has notched up 118 appearances for Atletico Madrid, including 27 in the Champions League. </span><span>Last season, he was a key figure as the Spanish side defeated Manchester United in the last-16.</span></p><p><span>While there are other examples, few of the 18 new additions at Forest epitomise the vast change in mood and ethos at the City Ground quite as well as Renan Lodi.</span></p><p><span>And, not for the first time, the persuasive powers of both the club hierarchy ‚Äî led by the Marinakis family ‚Äî and Steve Cooper came to the fore, as they sold their vision to Lodi.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‚ÄúThe club placed a lot of faith in me from the very first contact we had. They made a lot of effort for me to be here today,‚Äù Lodi told the club website. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to write my name into the club‚Äôs history. </span><span>I want Nottingham to stay in the Premier League. My main objective is also to go to the World Cup, representing Forest with the Brazilian national team. This club showed total faith in me and I want to give something back to them too.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>The deal is one that works well for all parties. Forest have paid a loan fee in the region of ‚Ç¨5m (¬£4.3m, $4.9m) and have an option to make the move permanent for ‚Ç¨30m. Atletico are expected to replace him by signing Tottenham‚Äôs Sergio Reguilon, who had also been the subject of interest from Forest.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/08/28061258/GettyImages-1242608376-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1706 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Lodi made <span>118 appearances for Atletico Madrid</span> (Photo: David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)</span><p><span>In the meantime, Forest have signed a genuinely exciting player. A 24-year-old with a rampaging, swashbuckling spirit.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span>Lodi‚Äôs desire to get forward and be involved in the final third could quickly make him a popular figure at the City Ground, where such qualities have been treasured in a left-back since the days of Stuart Pearce. They will certainly be a useful asset in a Forest side for which such attributes are seen as vital by Cooper, who likes his wing-backs to provide attacking width and thrive in the final third.</span></p><p><span>Lodi will definitely bring that, even if he is not always as strong defensively as he is getting forward. At Atletico, he was occasionally utilised as an out-and-out winger, as well as playing as wing-back and full-back.</span></p><p><span>Diego Simeone, the Atletico head coach, managed to simultaneously praise and criticise Lodi for his attitude after the move had been confirmed.</span></p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>#BemVindoLodi</a> üáßüá∑ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yVB3HRsA4V</a></p><p>‚Äî Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC) <a href=#>August 29, 2022</a></p><p><span>‚ÄúI am grateful for his work, his behaviour, always being willing to help wherever he was needed, as a starter or coming on in the second half. He has always done so in committed manner,‚Äù said Simeone. ‚ÄúI am not committed to anyone. There is an enormous competition in that area ‚Äî some like to compete and others prefer to go to other teams in order to have those minutes that gets them closer to being able to go to the World Cup.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>Lodi had been on the bench so far for Atletico this season, with Simeone picking Yannick Carrasco and Saul Niguez ahead of him. He is likely to be among the substitutes again as Forest head to Manchester City tomorrow night. But Lodi has already had a taste of the City Ground atmosphere, having flown into Nottingham in time to watch the 2-0 defeat to Spurs and it is unlikely it will be too long before he gets to experience it from a more central position.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/08/29135251/lodi-forest-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1804 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Lodi in the stands for the Tottenham game (Photo: Mike Egerton/PA Images via Getty Images)</span><p><span>‚ÄúI mentioned this to my agent (sat) in the stands, the high-pressure environment playing in front of the fans here ‚Äî I love it, and genuinely can‚Äôt wait to be playing and feeling the passion of a home crowd,‚Äù said Lodi. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited about the intensity of the game.

In his case, his background is testament to a young man who has always been determined to succeed, for very personal reasons.</span></p><p><span>In 2012, Lodi was spotted by the scouts of a soccer school run by a family with a long history of success in the food supply business, who had decided that there was also money to be made in football. </span><span>Lodi, then aged 13, was spotted by the Stival family in Sao Paulo and offered a trial. He impressed sufficiently to be signed to Stival‚Äôs amateur program and invited to live at the training centre at Athletico Paranaense, not long after his 14th birthday.</span></p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><span>Lodi would call his father on a nightly basis, asking to be allowed to return home. But even at that age, he was aware that he could help his family out of poverty with the ball at his feet. </span><span>‚ÄúI always put that goal in my head,‚Äù he said during his time in Madrid. ‚ÄúI said to myself: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to be the father of the family. I‚Äôm going to chase my dreams, and I‚Äôm going to try to give them a better condition ahead in the future‚Äô.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>Lodi made his debut for Athletico Paranaense in 2016 and went on to make 49 further appearances for them in the demanding surroundings of the Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana ‚Äî which they won in 2018 ‚Äî and the Recopa Sudamericana. </span><span>By the time Lodi moved to Atletico Madrid in a deal worth ‚Ç¨18m in June 2019,<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> he had already achieved enough to secure his family‚Äôs future.</a></span></p><p>Now, following his arrival in Nottingham, his signing represents the start of an exciting new chapter for both him and Forest.</p><p>And barring some seriously bad luck, their traditional left-back issues should be a thing of the past.</p><p>(Top photo: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57km5rb3FhaHxzfJFrZmlwX2h9cLLOq5ysrF2pv6K60p%2Bcq2WcpLGqedOamq2hk6h6sb7On6ClnV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-eco-friendly-dishwasher-detergents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="6 Best Eco-Friendly Dishwasher Detergents">&larr;
