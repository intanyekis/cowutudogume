In fact, over the years, Hunnam, Boone, Perlman, and the rest of the cast have been plenty busy, <a href=#>appearing on multiple TV shows and in other projects</a>.Of course, not all of them hit the big time; <a href=#>fans have wondered what happened to Ryan Hurst's career post-Sons</a> because he seemed to disappear from view.But years later, one can’t help but wonder which Sons of Anarchy star has earned the most today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drea-de-matteo-is-worth-15-to-18-million-today>Drea De Matteo Is Worth $15 To $18 Million Today</h2><p>De Matteo, who famously played Wendy Case, had been an established actress long before she booked a role on the show.

That’s what interested me about this world,” the actor told amNY.</p><p>“What do you do when you have dedicated your life to a certain skill set and through that belonging to a really deep sense of community … What do you do when all of that basically gets taken away from you?”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Son of Anarchy' Actor Katey Sagal Receives Support From Fans After Being Hit By A Car</a></span></p><p>As for Perlman, the actor starred in various films after exiting Sons of Anarchy.

It was a role that the actor pursued <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as soon as he learned that Clay was going to get killed off</a>.</p><p>“When I found out that Sons was coming to an end for me, I began looking and reading stuff,” Perlman told Esquire. “Hand of God was the third script I read.

For series creator Liz Feldman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress’ casting couldn’t have been more perfect</a>.</p><p>“We were looking for somebody that you could really believe would be Judy’s mom, so somebody who looks somewhat like her,” Feldman told TVLine. “But also somebody that could really balance out the comedy and her grit that we were looking for in this woman.”</p><p>Aside from these TV projects, Sagal did some film work, appearing in Pitch Perfect 2 and Bleed for This, among others. Today, the actress is said to be worth between $30 and $35 million.
