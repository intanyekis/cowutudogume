But the man has one of the most recognizable faces in all of reality TV. The narrator of the reality TV series Life Before Zero, Franzo has been around the reality TV scene for quite a while. He has been the narrator of Life Before Zero ever since the series first began airing in 2013. The series follows the exploits of people living in Alaska, as they talk about their daily struggles and explain the different techniques they use to survive in a sub-zero-degree environment. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of James Franzo.</p><h2>Early Life:</h2><p>James Franzo was born on February 11, 1970. One of the three siblings of the Franzo household, James shared much of his early life with his siblings Rocco Franzo and David Franzo. As a character who is often heard and rarely seen, little is known about James’s early life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Life-below-Zero-narrator-James-Franzo-.jpg><h2>Finding his ways:</h2><p>Before James was charming people with his voice, he was impressing them with his acting skills. His first acting job was in the hit soap Days of our Lives. Even though James’s role in the TV series was short-lived, he managed to use it as a foothold for his career moving forward. Over the years, James has acted in a few movies including the 2015 release, The Prison Web.</p><h2>Life Before Zero:</h2><p>For all his acting exploits, James’s best ticket to fame came with his voice. He is the narrator of the reality TV series, Life Before Zero. For many fans of the show, James is a completely unknown character. They are often centered around the character on-screen, and completely forget the silky smooth voice guiding them. However, people who have been around the series since Day 1, understand the importance of James in making the series what it is. Since it first began airing in 2013, the series has received praise from fans and critics around the world. The series has also bagged quite a few awards including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Reality Program. The series is currently in its twentieth season which premiered on</p><h2>Personal Life:</h2><p>The man known to charm people with his voice, James is a family man. He has two sons and one of them is Joseph Ferratti Franzo even though the name of the mother is not available. Also, we are completely in the dark regarding the duration of the relationship with his ex-wife or the reason for the separation. All we can say is James has found someone new to rely on.</p><p>The reality television personality is currently in a relationship with <span class="x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xi81zsa"><span class=xt0psk2>Randalyn Young. She is from Haiku, Hawaii, and formerly worked as a Catering Sales manager at &nbsp;Bon Appétit Management Company. The pair made their relationship official on October 17, 2022, with a Facebook <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> coming from the lady herself.</span></span></p><p><span class="x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xi81zsa"><span class=xt0psk2>James also has been vocal about his relationship with his now girlfriend and giving minor details of the encounter which goes way back. Sharing a memory from July 2002, James <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> her as the “warmest, Bambi-Esque, emerald green eyes girl,” and how despite three failed attempts of connecting with her, James was ready to have more. Young celebrates her birthday on November 22 and James took the chance to wish her with a Facebook post caption, “Happy Birthday, my love!”</span></span></p><h2>A scare along the way:</h2><p>James had struggled with heart problems for quite a while. He was diagnosed with advanced Cardio Myopathy in the Fall of 2014. <span>In 2015, James was listed for a heart transplant and had to undergo surgery for it. Fortunately, the surgery was completed without any major complications and James is in the best of health.</span></p><h2>Social Media presence</h2><p>James is on Facebook where he goes by the name <a href=#>Jimmy Franzo</a>. Going through it we can say he is a person who values friendship and family above anything. We also came to know his mother is Gloria Franzo who lives in Henderson, Nevada and his father passed away some years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/James-Franzo-mother-Gloria.jpg><p>James is also active on Instagram too and goes by the username <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jimmyfranzo</a> which has a fan following of 1,576.</p><h2>Age, Birthdate, Ethnicity</h2><p>Born on February 11, 1970, the birthdate makes the voice-over artist currently 52 years old. Aquarius-born, James holds American citizenship and if ethnicity is concerned, he comes Caucasian household.</p><h2>How Rich is James Franzo? Net Worth</h2><p>There are merits of being part of a popular famous reality show. In regard to the financial aspect, the pay is high, and when it comes to fame it is easy to say Life Below Zero has garnered wider audiences over the years. Some online sites say James’ salary per episode is 4500 which is not the figure revealed by National Geography but a guess. Also, his net worth of $300,000 running around the internet is not true. For sure his net worth is higher and currently under review.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=3><tr><td>Name</td><td>James Franzo</td></tr><tr><td>Other Name</td><td>Jimmy Franzo</td></tr><tr><td>Birthdate</td><td>February 11, 1970</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>53 years old</td></tr><tr><td>Birthplace</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Gloria Franzo</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Siblings</td><td>Rocco Franzo and David Franzo</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Television personality, Actor, Voice-over artist</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>Relationship Status</td><td>Committed</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse/Partner</td><td>Randalyn Young</td></tr><tr><td>Ex-wife</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Joseph Ferratti Franzo</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Height</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac</td><td>Aquarius</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>This article was originally published on April 25, 2020, at 4:34 am Universal time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGihmqWVqHqnvsCnsahlkp68cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./megan-mullally-married-husband-children-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Megan Mullally Married, Husband, Kids, Movies, TV Shows, Net Worth, Bio">&larr;
